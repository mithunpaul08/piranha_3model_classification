The names are also used to refer to acorpse or hospital patient whose identity is unknown. This practice is widely used in the United States and Canada, but is rarely used in other English-speaking countries including the United Kingdom itself, from where the use of "John Doe" in a legal context originates. The names Joe Bloggs or John Smith are used in the UK instead, as well as in Australia and New Zealand.John Doe is sometimes used to refer to a typical male in other contexts as well, in a similar manner to John Q. Public, known in Great Britain as Joe Public, John Smith or Joe Bloggs. For example, the first name listed on a form is often John Doe, along with a fictional address or other fictional information to provide an example of how to fill in the form. The name is also used frequently in popular culture, for example in the Frank Capra film Meet John Doe. John Doe was also the name of a 2002 American television series.Similarly, a child or baby whose identity is unknown may be referred to as Baby Doe. A notorious murder case in Kansas City, Missouri, referred to the baby victim as Precious Doe. Other unidentified female murder victims are Cali Doe and Princess Doe. Additional persons may be called James Doe, Judy Doe, etc. However, to avoid possible confusion, if two anonymous or unknown parties are cited in a specific case or action, the surnames Doe and Roe may be used simultaneously; for example, "John Doe v. Jane Roe". If several anonymous parties are referenced, they may simply be labelled John Doe #1, John Doe #2, etc. (the U.S. Operation Delego cited 21 (numbered) "John Doe"s) or labelled with other variants of Doe / Roe / Poe / etc. Other early alternatives such as John Stiles and Richard Miles are now rarely used, and Mary Major has been used in some American federal cases.File created by http://www.online-convert.comMore example files: http://www.online-convert.com/file-typeText of Example content: Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doe)License: Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)Feel free to use and share the file according to the license above.--------------050008080707050500070109Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit<html>  <head>    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">  </head>  <body text="#000000" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">    <font style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2"> </font><b><font        color="#660b23" face="Arial"> </font></b> <font      style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2">      <div style="POSITION: relative"><h2>EML test file</h2>Purpose: Provide example of this file type<br>Document file type: EML<br>Version: 1.0<br>Remark:<br><br>Example content:<br>The names "<b>John Doe</b>" for males, "<b>Jane Doe</b>" or "<b>Jane Roe</b>" for females, or "Jonnie Doe" and "Janie Doe" for children, or just "Doe" non-gender-specifically are used as placeholder names for a party whose true identity is unknown or must be withheld in a legal action, case, or discussion.

And they share a                                           deep pride that goes with being from the south" --George Mooney, the                                           irreplaceable "Voice of the Volunteers" in the 1950s                                           "The true football fan pays no attention to time or mileage when there is a                                           big game to see." --John Heisman, head coach, Auburn University                                           "In Baton Rouge, the focal point of everything is Tiger football." --Jim                                           Corbett                                           "In Baton Rouge, it's not a law to love LSU, but the city fathers could                                           probably get one passed if they needed to." --Charles McClendon, head                                           coach, LSU                                           "After so many years at a school, you become a member of the football                                           family." --Bob Fulton                                           "I don't care where a man comes from or how he spells his name. All I                                           ask is that he be loyal to Georgia, proud of that jersey, and try like the                                           devil to win." --Wally Butts, head coach, Georgia                                           "Deep inside, we're still the boys of autumn, that magic time of the year                                           that once swept us on to America's fields." --Archie Manning                                           "Tradition is a rich asset for any team. Tradition and success are traveling                                           companions." --Wallace Wade, head coach, University of Alabama                                           The above quotes were excerpted from Criswell Freeman's "The                                           Wisdom of Southern Football" (1995).                                           As football season creeps ever closer, the avid enthusiast finds it difficult                                           to contain the unbridled excitement and anticipation that bubbles like                                           summertime sweat within their pigskin-thirsty souls. Football season is                                           that special time of year that not only means the beginning of another                                           healthy slate of competitive gridiron contests filled with spectacular plays                                           and high drama--it's also the definitive rallying point for the onslaught of                                           all the expected pomp, pageantry, and circumstance that goes                                           hand-in-hand with the college game. In no conference in the country is                                           this statement more true than the tradition-rich Southeastern Conference.                                           The ongoing rivalries, the colorful histories and traditions, the premier                                           tailgating, the coquettish southern bells in their gameday garb, the reunion                                           of lasting friendships, and the competitive fire and spirit that accompany                                           the game, all make the entire SEC football experience a very real, and                                           visceral one--even to the most casual observer.                                            The Southeastern Conference is unequivocally the paragon of the college                                           football conferences, and the 2000 season figures not to disappoint the                                           thousands of rabid fans that flock to the stadiums each week throughout                                           the southeast; as well as the millions more who tune in from home on the                                           tube to follow their respective teams. Quite frankly, SEC football has                                           never been bigger, or better. The southern cultural phenomenon only                                           continues to grow with each passing season. The number of fans, and the                                           competition that they long for each and every weekend of the football                                           season, has never been bigger or better. In 1999, the SEC again set                                           attendance records for its games, and with the many recent expansions to                                           existing stadiums in the conference, those records should again fall at the                                           end of this season.                                            Five Reasons Tiger Fans Can Be Excited About the 2000 Football                                           Season                                           1. Lou Tepper is no longer in Tiger Town.                                           Heralded by professional defensive coaches as a "guru" and a "defensive                                           genius" prior to his arrival at LSU, the former Illinois head coach led the                                           LSU defense to its worst two-year performance in the history of the                                           school (1893). If you are interested in immortalizing the Tepper legacy at                                           LSU for your scrapbook, copies of his book "Complete Linebacking"                                           can still be obtained (at a discounted price no less) at most local book                                           outlets. In Tepper's absence, maybe the Tigers will return to the days of                                           coach Charlie Mac and the standout defensive units that were his                                           trademark while at the Ole War Skule. Speaking of Coach Mac, I caught                                           up with him last week at his home and he sounded as spry as a spring                                           chicken. He told me that he is doing great and that he enjoys cycling in                                           the mornings to stay in shape. Coach told me that he hopes that the LSU                                           players have fun this year, because, he said, "...having fun is what it's all                                           about. If you can't have any fun, you're in big trouble."                                           2. Contrary to popular belief, the Tigers are deep at quarterback.                                           Preseason prognosticators have cited the injury to Rohan Davey as a                                           core reason why the Tigers will have trouble at the quarterback position.                                           They all opined early that both Booty and Nall had difficulties leading the                                           offense and that the injury to Davey was a major setback to the Tiger                                           offense. However, reports from summer camp indicate that Rohan is now                                           within 95-100 percent of his normal range of motion on his knee, and in                                           light of this it would appear that the Tigers are again three-deep at the                                           quarterback position. The resurgence of Rohan is a tremendous boost to                                           the team. Known for his leadership ability both on and off the field,                                           Rohan possesses the true grit that wins ball games. I caught up with                                           former LSU All-American and coach Gaynell Tinsley at his Highland                                           Road home a few weeks ago, and he told me that he thought that                                           Rohan's performance against Arkansas was the best he had ever seen by                                           an LSU quarterback. True frosh Marcus Randall impressed in the LA                                           High School All-Star game last week, but he is a likely redshirt with the                                           logjam of experienced competition ahead of him.                                           3. Nick Saban.                                           Derided unfairly early by most SEC media outlets as being "incompatible"                                           with Louisianians' unique culture and high football expectations, Saban is                                           easily the best thing to happen to LSU football since Kevin Faulk. A                                           consummate professional, Saban exudes confidence and paints a clear                                           vision for the future of the program. His presence in Red Stick has made                                           an immediate impact on the program, evidenced by the recent glowing                                           comments at media days by seniors Louis William and Fred Booker.                                           Saban was also unfairly chastised heavily by the media for his inability to                                           bring any assistants with him to LSU from his previous staff at Michigan                                           State. However, Coach Saban recently aptly stated at the SEC media                                           days that only a couple of his previous staff members had ever been                                           "south of the Mason-Dixon line." That notwithstanding, you cannot argue                                           with the fact that Saban has compiled a great staff of southern coaches.                                           Tiger fans should find further solace in the fact that coach Saban has                                           never had a losing record as a football coach.                                           4. Trev Faulk & Bradie James at Linebacker.                                           All good defenses have a common trait--great linebacking play, and you'll                                           be hard-pressed to find two better young horses than these two. Outside                                           linebacker and pass rushing specialist Jeremy Lawrence is another super                                           sophomore to keep your eyes on. These guys all have good wheels, and                                           will put the leather on you when they get the chance. James' number 11                                           Faulk's recent acquisition of Mealey's lucky 7 will undoubtedly prompt                                           many fans and commentators to make countless puns and jokes related                                           to LSU's 7-11 linebacking duo.                                           5. Predictions Don't Mean Diddly                                           The other day I was scouring through the many rolls of microfilm in the                                           basement of Middleton Library at LSU, and I stumbled upon this most                                           interesting fact:                                            In August, 1958, LSU was picked to finish 8th out of 10 SEC teams.                                           Auburn, which had won the national championship the year prior with                                           Shug Jordan, was picked to repeat as conference champs, followed by                                           Ole Miss and Mississippi State.                                            Of course, in spite of the dismal preseason ranking by the SEC                                           sportswriters, the Bengal Tigers went on to record their only unblemished                                           season and national college football championship to date. This story                                           should only serve to encourage fans that are despondent over the                                           outcome of the past two seasons in Tigertown. Anything can happen in                                           the SEC, and remember, the old adage says that "history repeats itself."                                           Keep the faith Tigerfans!                                           Until next time...",0,0,0

As far as use of the WSCC data goes, I noticed that you've got table entries and are showing '0' values for a  lot of plants that have never reported reliably, such as Hermiston, Gadsby, Priest Rapids, Wanapum, etc.-- I'd leave those out until we see some plausible data reported. Also, we don't use data from plants where better numbers are available from other sources, e.g. most Pacific Northwest federal hydro.Also, are you doing anything to filter out bad hours? There are intermittent periods where series of zeros or series of identical readings are erroneously reported due to telemetry failures. If you're computing totals or averages from the WSCC data that are consistently smaller than known, accurate reports, then this might be the cause.TimMatthew Lenhart07/05/2000 01:59 PMTo: Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tim Heizenrader/PDX/ECT@ECT, Cooper Richey/PDX/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Enclosed is a copy of the generation reports we put together using your generation database.

The problems that we are seeing are one of three (3) possibilities:  1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was the correct password) and been given the error message that you have exceeded your opportunities for today, and you receive the message "You have failed to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset." This is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you online (on the phone). Should you receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @ 830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182.

Please try again using the last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the primary account holder.  3)  If you see this error message "Invalid login; please try again" (after three [3] or more tries), then you possibly fall into this last category.

And, at the University of California's Berkeley campus  this year, a flashlight.  As state officials and utilities struggle to maintain the power supply during  California's continuing energy shortage, administrators and professors at the  31,000-student campus are planning for the possibility that rolling blackouts  may disrupt exams, which began on Friday and run through next Saturday. ''People here are used to interruptions,'' Sara Abbas, 21, a senior  communications major, said with a shrug as she studied in a cafe near campus.  ''People walking in, people running around buck naked and whatnot. People  have cut the power lines. They just reschedule.''  In an e-mail message sent Wednesday, the executive vice chancellor, Paul R.  Gray, advised instructors to use ''individual discretion to decide the  disposition of their examinations once the exam has started.'' Among the  options: delay the test until the lights return; postpone it until a  Saturday; grade the incomplete test; or cancel the exam altogether.  Professors are also encouraged to check a Web site to see if their exam rooms  have windows. ''In some classrooms,'' Mr. Gray noted, ''students may have  sufficient natural light.''  The rolling blackouts could hit most of the campuses of the University of  California and California State University. The two systems are embroiled in  a legal dispute with Enron Energy Services, a Houston-based company that, in  February, cut short a four-year contract to provide electricity directly to  the universities. For now, the two systems -- among the largest energy  consumers in the state -- are being supplied by Pacific Gas and Electric and  Southern California Edison.  Though several medical centers and the Davis, Los Angeles and Riverside  campuses of the University of California system are exempt from the  blackouts, the rest of the campuses have been put on alert.  At Berkeley, the warning from Mr. Gray only heightened pre-exam stress  levels.  ''Stopping in the middle of a final would be detrimental to my grade because  I save the hardest questions until the end,'' said Heidi West, 20, a  sophomore majoring in political science.  Aaron Chung, a senior studying cognitive science, said it would be unfair to  grade half-finished exams because he often circled answers instinctively,  planning to return later with more care. ''The only thing I don't have a  problem with is if the professors give everyone A's,'' Mr. Chung, 23, said.  ''You have to be under a lot of duress for that to happen.''  Gary L. Firestone, a biology professor, said he would move his 500-member  class out into the sunshine and tell students to spread their blue books on  the grass. But Jeff Good, a graduate student who teaches Introduction to  Syntax and Semantics, said he would probably cancel the exam because the  final counts for only 20 percent of the grade.  That is what Michelle Chen, a junior linguistics major in Mr. Good's class,  is hoping for.  ''I would love a blackout,'' Ms. Chen said. ''I'm going to turn on my  air-conditioner. My toaster, too.''  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    Business British Telecom Patience Wheatcroft  05/12/2001 The Times of London News International Final 4 55 (Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 2001)  BRITISH TELECOM has inflicted enough damage on itself in the past year. But  others are still lining up to put the boot in. Hours after the company  announced a Pounds 5.9 billion rights issue and the separation of cash-hungry  BT Wireless, Moody's Investors Service lowered BT's credit rating. This  thumbs-down will cost BT an extra Pounds 35 million a year on existing loans  as well as making future working capital more expensive.  The timing is odd. One of the two other main agencies presented with the same  BT proposals maintained its rating and the other edged it down so little that  change-of-rating clauses were not triggered. In the meantime, the market  prices of BT debt have been rising. The Enron Cost of Credit, which measures  the overall risk premium on BT borrowing, has halved since mid February. Such  costly inconsistencies must focus more critical attention on the agencies,  whose power has grown out of proportion to their accountability. Moody's verdict is, however, peanuts compared with the cost to BT of the  whims of Stephen Byers and the UK competition authorities. Moody's will no  doubt be aghast to learn that Yell could be worth Pounds 1 billion less as a  result.  In 1996 the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that BT's Yellow Pages  had an 85 per cent monopoly of its market and made it sign undertakings to  cut prices by 2 per cent a year in real terms. The Office of Fair Trading has  reviewed this report; predictably, it has found that the enforced price cuts  have kept competition down and kept Yell's market share up.  The reasoning behind OFT advice that annual real price cuts should be doubled  is closed to scrutiny until Mr Byers has a new BT undertaking. But it appears  to argue that the market is still a monopoly, so Yell must be charging too  much, so prices should fall further.  The result, according to those formerly eager to buy Yell, is that a growth  business has been turned into a stagnant one, losing all momentum. This  sounds typical of the dead hand of UK regulation. It must strengthen the  resolve of BT's new leaders to remodel what the authorities so hate to the  greater advantage of shareholders.  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

OUTLOOK Outlook Houston needs to think small about future technology WILLIAM DYLAN POWELL  05/13/2001 Houston Chronicle 2 STAR 4 (Copyright 2001)  OK, it's test time - sort of like a breakfast-time Rorschach test for Outlook  readers. Here we go: What's the first thing that comes to mind when someone  mentions Houston?  Time's up. Your answers may have been energy, medicine or seemingly random  acts of highway closure. But how about something very, very small? While  Houston may not exactly be synonymous with all things tiny, we may want to  start giving more mind share to the world of the miniature. As technology  advances, Houston may owe a great deal to the study of small substances. Nanotechnology is the study of creating functional structures on a molecular  scale (the prefix "nano" means one billionth, or 10 to the ninth power  numerically). Its theories and practices give scientists the means to  construct useful entities using the smallest known particle of unaltered  matter.  Before your eyes glaze over in a terminology-induced science class flashback,  you should hear some of the possibilities that this technology could afford  residents of the Bayou City and their respective commercial enterprises. The  possibilities give the works of science fiction author Ray Bradbury a run for  their money, and include producing computers the size of viruses or factories  that could fit neatly on your desk. Cancer-destroying robots could roam a  patient's innards like mounted police at a spring break celebration.  Eventually, all diseases and mutations could be eliminated. And all  manufacturing processes would become waste-free, both in terms of the  environment and from a business process standpoint.  Sound like science fiction? Maybe, but truth is rapidly catching up with  fiction. A team of university researchers recently figured out how to make a  functional switch out of a single organic molecule. Discoveries such as these  have spawned several branch fields of study including nanobiotics, NEMS  (nanoelectromechanical systems) and nanomedicine.  This technology would surely change the world. But it would especially affect  Houston. Applications for nanotechnology are a great fit for Houston's  economic landscape. The chemical industry already has begun conducting  research in small-sizing certain chemical compounds. And the energy industry,  still our darling, has great interest in the power management possibilities  of nanotech. This could be Houston's next great vehicle for economic  development.  Nay-sayers have expressed caution regarding progress in this field on two  separate fronts. First on how distant potential commercial offerings remain;  and secondly on the potential dangers of combining genetic engineering,  nanotechnology and robotics (for fear of creating self-assembling intelligent  machines as often portrayed in science-fiction movies). But too much  technological progress is happening at once for the possibilities not to whet  the appetites of the entire scientific and business communities.  Already, developmental overtures have been heard from Houston's little sister  to the north. The Dallas-Fort Worth region and its growing base of  semiconductor, light assembly and defense industries are keeping a close eye  on developments in small science. In March, a private-sector company donated  $2.5 million to the University of Texas at Dallas for nanotech research. And  a handful of Dallas-area groups have been quietly conducting research of  their own. This money augments the federal government's nearly half-billion  dollar allotment of 2001 research funding for nanotechnology. Houston has its  own projects, but they receive far less publicity.  Houston's public nanoscience efforts have been centered mostly on Rice  University's grand Turks of academia. Pushing the envelope of academic  excellence as usual, Rice's heavyweight research barons continue to generate  and distribute knowledge on the many potential applications of this exciting  technology. But as successful as they are, they receive far less publicity  and support than other less commercially significant disciplines.  On May 29, leaders from the energy, medical and technology sectors will  converge at the Houston Technology Forum to discuss various technology trends  that will affect Houston's future. Will the keynote speakers (chief  executives from Compaq, the Texas Medical Center and Enron) address the issue  of what Houston is doing to prepare for advances in nanotechnology and its  potential economic impact on the region?  I certainly hope so. Energy, medicine and technology are the terra firma of  Houston's economy. Each of these industry sectors could reap profound  benefits by bringing nanotechnology's concepts to light.  Sure, the fruits of this nascent science are still a long way off. But it's  going to become remarkably important sooner than we think. So while  Houstonians are well known for our love of largeness, it's time to think  small. Let's take a careful evaluation of what this technology could mean to  our city and its economic development.  Drawing   Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    A Panel plots new course for area's future / Education, economics, quality of  life top group's list of needed improvements MIKE SNYDER Staff  05/13/2001 Houston Chronicle 4 STAR 33 (Copyright 2001)  A group of prominent business executives, worried that Houston's reputation  as an unpleasant place to live imperils its future, is developing a plan to  transform the city's educational system, urban design and economic base.  The work of the Center for Houston's Future, a nonprofit group affiliated  with the Greater Houston Partnership, reflects growing concern that Houston  must reposition itself as a vibrant, desirable destination if it is to  compete in an economic climate that empowers skilled workers to live wherever  they choose. Creating such a "livable city," leaders of the effort say, would in turn  enrich the lives of every Houstonian.  "The interests of the business community are fully aligned with the interests  of the community at large," said Eugene H. Vaughan, a money management  executive and board chairman of the Center for Houston's Future.  A report prepared for the organization by a business-based task force  recommends that local leaders challenge long-held assumptions that have  discouraged meaningful land-use planning. It sketches a vision of Houston 20  years from now in which technology and other tools have revolutionized public  education, "livable city centers" have changed the physical landscape and  current civic leaders have groomed a new, more diverse generation of  successors.  The report argues that the business community's traditional leadership role  in Houston's civic affairs should continue. But it suggests the models of  business influence that prevailed in "the old days" should be re-examined.  "Those were the days when oil was king, and Houston was the energy capital of  the world - the days when a handful of `big' leaders, including CEOs of major  corporations, could meet in a room together and decide on the future of  Houston," the report states.  "But times have changed, and there is far less tolerance in Houston's highly  diverse, egalitarian society for a hidden oligarchy to run things, no matter  how benevolent those leaders might be."  The center's board includes top executives of some of Houston's most  successful and influential companies, including Enron Chairman Ken Lay; Ned  Holmes, chairman and CEO of Parkway Investments/Texas Inc.; James Royer,  president and CEO of Turner, Collie & Braden Inc.; William White, president  and CEO of WEDGE Group Inc.; and Jim Kollaer, president and CEO of the  Greater Houston Partnership.  Vaughan said the stature of the board members is an indication that the group  is not likely to generate plans that will simply sit on a shelf.  "They've got so many demands on their time that they're not going to fool  around with something that is ill-conceived," he said.  Rice University sociology professor Stephen Klineberg, one of the experts who  advised the task force that generated the report, agreed that the center's  work could be very influential.  "This is the first time there's been a systematic, coordinated effort on the  part of the business community" to improve Houston's quality of life,  Klineberg said.  The Center for Houston's Future was created in the early 1990s primarily as a  source of research information for the partnership, Houston's premier  business organization. But its role changed about two years ago, Vaughan  said, when Holmes became chairman of the partnership and encouraged the  center to take an aggressive approach to planning for the region's future.  Last summer, the center organized three workshops attended by 36 people  representing a cross section of the business community. These 10-day,  seven-night events, led by professional facilitators and featuring various  guest speakers, produced a report outlining four possible future Houston  scenarios.  James D. Calaway, a member of the center's board, said the details outlined  in the four scenarios are intended to be "illustrative" and are not  necessarily the actions the organization ultimately will recommend. However,  they provide insight into the direction of the group's thinking, he said.  In the first scenario, based on the assumption that local planning and  decision-making proceed much as they have in the past, the workshop  participants speculate that tension between the city and suburbs increases to  the point that the Legislature strips Houston of its annexation power.  Development is greatly restricted because of failure to meet clean-air  standards, property values plummet and the City Council must pass a large tax  rate increase.  Houston becomes a stronghold of low-wage, service-sector employment, and the  gap between rich and poor widens: "For many who live there, it's simply a  large urban sprawl, adrift in the global economy, or it's a three-year  hardship post on the way to something more desirable."  Scenario two suggests that Houston's leaders transform the educational system  by developing a "Teacher Network" that delivers Internet-based educational  resources into every classroom and teacher's home in the region. This in turn  leads to a communitywide electronic educational network, with every home in  the Houston area connected to the Internet by 2007.  These efforts, combined with universal, full-day preschool care, lead to  state-of-the-art local schools by 2010, with almost universal high school  graduation rates and 75 percent of these graduates going on to college or  technical training programs.  The report does not estimate the cost of these measures or identify how they  would be funded. Potential sources, Calaway said, include local, state and  federal tax money, private grants and reallocation of funds now being spent  on more traditional educational programs.  In scenario three, local leaders take bold steps to overcome Houston's  reputation for sprawl, dirty air and lack of green space - perceptions that  hamper efforts to attract the talent needed to keep the region economically  competitive.  These leaders develop a vision of Houston based on the creation of "livable  city centers" - major activity centers targeted for redesign and  redevelopment - and the connection of these centers through "personal and  public transport in corridors that delight the eye."  Within the centers, streets are reconstructed to better accommodate  pedestrians. Financial incentives prompt developers to provide a wide range  of housing styles, including substantial affordable housing. The Main Street  light rail line is built, succeeds spectacularly and is followed by more rail  lines extending in various directions.  To accomplish these goals, the report states, local leaders must overcome  their "ingrained suspicion of planning," and the City Council must adopt  "new, more prescriptive development standards" within the livable city  centers. Early successes lead to a public referendum authorizing the  expenditure of $8 billion over 20 years to create the "livable city."  Scenario four focuses on making Houston a "crossroads of the world economy."  The city's business leadership becomes broader and more diverse, and it turns  its energy toward diversifying the economy.  The energy industry, adapting to the new economic climate, transforms its  business model and creates new, high-tech enterprises. Space, nanotechnology  and biotechnology research help launch hundreds of companies that quickly  become significant global players.  The workshop participants concluded that Houston must accomplish key elements  of scenarios two, three and four if it is to become a "true world-class city  in which to live and conduct business."  Calaway and Vaughan said the next steps will include designating committees  to develop specific recommendations in each of the broad areas studied, such  as education and quality of life. Working groups then will be established to  begin translating these ideas into policy, they said.  Although the center is focused on the long term, they said, it must produce  results as soon as possible.  "If we do not get serious about this, 20 years from now we're going to be a  low-wage environment, putting people in very, very dead- end jobs," Calaway  said during a recent presentation on the group's work to members of the  nonprofit Gulf Coast Institute.  "We've got to get the quality of life right, but we've also got to make sure  that we educate these kids for our future."  Mugs: 1. Ken Lay (p. 45); 2. Ned Holmes (p. 45); 3. James Royer (p. 45); 4.

MSEB not to pick up 15 pc in DPC after phase II completion  05/13/2001 Press Trust of India Limited (c) 2001 PTI Ltd.  Mumbai, May 13 (PTI) Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has decided  not to pick up the remaining 15 per cent equity in Enron-promoted Dabhol  Power Company (DPC), which it was earlier supposed to, after the complete  construction of the entire USD three billion power project in Dabhol.  "It is true that we had promised to take the 15 per cent, translating into  infusion of around USD 65 million and given the serious financial stress the  board is facing, it is not going to be possible for us to participate in the  phase II of the project", a senior MSEB official told PTI here Sunday. Currently, Enron International owns 65 per cent, MSEB -15 per cent, General  Electric and Bechtel 10 per cent each.  However, MSEB is yet to send an official intimation to DPC in this regard,  the official said adding the board would inform the company soon after the  completion of the project.  DPC's USD 1.87 billion phase II would be fired on June seven, 2001, thus  marking completion of the 2,184 MW project.  DPC, which received a Foreign Investment and Promotion Board clearance in  last December for its 10.83 billion foreign Direct Investment, has not been  able to scout an alternative fifth partner for MSEB's equity.  The company had decided to off load the 15 per cent of its current holding of  65 per cent to a new entity, as according to the company's global  debt-consolidation it needed to maintain its stake at 50 per cent in DPC  after its completion.  In order to avoid any delay, Enron had agreed to meet up with the equity  shortfall as per the former's agreement with its lenders.

Enron plans to pull out of Gulf gas project: MEED  05/13/2001 Agence France-Presse (Copyright 2001)  DUBAI, May 13 (AFP) - Enron Corp. of the United States plans to pull out of a  project to deliver Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Middle East  Economic Digest (MEED) reported on Sunday.  Enron is a partner in the Dolphin Energy project along with the  Franco-Belgian company TotalFinaElf and the Abu Dhabi government- owned UAE  Offsets Group (UOG). Its role is to build a pipeline under the Gulf between  Qatar and Abu Dhabi. "The profit margin for Enron would be low. At present, the Dolphin project is  being developed primarily as an upstream venture," an industry source told  MEED.  Another industry publication, Middle East Economic Survey (MEES), reported  last week that the two other partners regarded Enron's estimated cost for  constructing and laying the 350-kilometre (220- mile) undersea pipeline as  too high.  "There is talk of new partners," a source with TotalFinaElf, whose role is to  develop a block in Qatar's giant North Field, told MEED. "But whatever  happens, we are staying."  On March 14, Qatar and the UAE inked a 25-year term sheet agreement on the  project, setting the volume at two billion cubic feet (20 million cubic  metres) of natural gas per day.  Differences over pricing and volumes had put back the signing of the  agreement for two years after a first statement of principle for Dolphin was  inked by Qatar and UOG in March 1999.  According to MEES, Qatar Petroleum and UOG have finally agreed on a gas price  formula of 1.3 dollars per million BTU (British thermal units) following  "high-level political intervention from Qatar and Abu Dhabi".  TotalFinaElf and Enron are strategic partners in the multi- billion-dollar  project, each holding a 24.5 percent share in Dolphin Energy Limited (DEL),  with UOG retaining a controlling 51 percent stake.  From Abu Dhabi, the gas is to be distributed inside the emirate and on to  Dubai and Oman. An extension to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline is also  planned, as part of a regional gas network.  hc/rp  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    BUSINESS SMALL BUSINESS / Pleasure cruisin' / Yacht fleet owner offers customers what  amounts to limo service on the lake CAROL RUST Special to the Chronicle  05/13/2001 Houston Chronicle 2 STAR 1 (Copyright 2001)  KEMAH - Tom Lober trundled home from second grade with a three- tiered wooden  box he'd made at school.  "This is my houseboat," he told his mother 35 years ago. "When I grow up, I'm  going to live on a boat." His practical-minded mother put the "boat" to work as a patio plant stand  until it finally rotted from a decade of exposure.  On a recent evening, Lober stood on the bow of one of his four charter  yachts, enjoying the sunset-tinted water and a mild breeze as the 100-foot  luxury boat moved quietly from Clear Lake into Galveston Bay.  "This is what I love," Lober said, scanning a horizon dotted with distant  boats. "The others are here to party, but this is it for me."  The founder and owner of Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts spoke calmly against  the din of a mini-Mardi Gras heating up on middeck, where bead-clad  executives were letting their hair down at their annual appreciation party  for a major customer. A Mae West look- alike hired for the event meandered  among them, handing out cigars and sultry comments in her mermaid-cut white  dress studded with faux pearls and a white feather boa twirled about her  neck.  In the eight and one-half years since the 42-year-old Lober started Star  Fleet, he's seen everything from fire-eaters to hula dancers as entertainment  on the hundreds of custom cruises his staff of 70 puts together each year.  Last year, the company booked 400 cruises, which translated into $2.3 million  in gross sales, in events ranging from Gulf Coast versions of company picnics  to a bat mitzvah with a Gilligan's Island theme. One guy recently plunked  down $2,000 to charter an entire boat for a date.  One of Lober's seven captains is, handily, a licensed minister for weddings.  Star Fleet staff recently added squirt guns, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks as  regular on-board equipment.  "It's a bizarre business," Lober said. "Nothing seems unusual anymore."  Nearly all Star Fleet's cruises include dinner. His kitchen staff does the  prep work for hors d'oeuvres and main courses on land near the marina,  transferring them to a generous galley on board before customers arrive. The  galley crew does the final cooking.  Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts is one of about a dozen businesses of its  size in the country that provides strictly private charter yacht cruises, but  Lober has hundreds of competitors locally.  "I'm competing with caterers, hotels, restaurants - anyone in the eating,  drinking and party business," he said. "People say there are two things  you're never supposed to own: a boat and a restaurant. I put a restaurant on  a boat."  Last month, he launched what he believes is the first-ever water limousine, a  30-foot yacht complete with wet bar, sound system, leather couches, TV and  VCR that takes small groups to waterfront restaurants and bars, just like a  limo does on land.  Sometimes, his clients hop off and dine at one of the restaurants on the  Kemah Boardwalk while the limo is anchored beside it. In other cases, waiters  deliver the food to the boat, equipped with removable dining tables that can  seat 14, and the customers dine while cruising Clear Lake.  Lober was a natural shoo-in for a career on the water. His father owned a  supply boat business in Houston and a fleet of shrimp boats based in  Trinidad. He eventually became president of his dad's supply boat business  after getting a master's degree in maritime management from Texas A&M  Maritime Academy in Galveston in 1981.  But he still had that idea from second grade that grew from living on a boat  to providing exclusive entertainment on the water.  In 1986, he joined the Passenger Vessel Association, a national group of  vessel owners that provides public or private cruises for gaming, ecotourism  or other entertainment. He attended seminars, talked to boat owners,  researched trends in the industry and tried to figure out what it would take  to float his idea.  Lober drew up plans for a boat big enough to accommodate up to 150  passengers, but with a three-foot draft to keep from running aground in the  notoriously shallow Clear Lake and Galveston Bay.  "I wanted to be able to take that boat anywhere on the lake," which is five  feet deep in places, he said.  Bankers were skeptical when he approached them for a loan.  "This was a new business in Houston that had never been done before," Lober  said. "They had no confidence.  "I finally got to the point where I'd just take my business plan into a bank  and say, `I know I'm not going to get a loan - just look at what I've got and  tell me what it needs,' " he said.  Even without a loan in place, Lober began hands-on research. During the week,  he still worked at his father's supply boat business, but flew to Fort  Lauderdale, Fla., on weekends to work as a deck hand and food server for a  charter yacht company to learn the business from the bottom up.  After a year of loan seeking, he found a lender at the Passenger Vessel  Association's annual meeting. Caterpillar Finance agreed to lend him 60  percent of the $950,000 in construction costs if he installed Caterpillar  engines on the boat.  Construction took a year, during which Lober continued his research, serving  drinks on weekends aboard a charter boat on the Detroit River and Lake St.  Clair.  Finally, Lober launched Star Gazer in October 1993.  The maritime academy might have taught him how to navigate by the stars, but  it didn't prepare him for marketing.  "I didn't know what I was doing," Lober said. "The first year, I spent  $125,000 in marketing blunders," including a $50,000 mass mail campaign that  he called "a total flop."  Marketing was twice as expensive as he thought it would be and took twice as  long for potential customers to understand the concept he was trying to sell,  he said. Meanwhile, his boat sat in the stall for up to three weeks at a  time.  Lober had a $30,000 monthly overhead in debt service, office rental,  insurance and slip fees, and "I still had to pay it if the boat didn't leave  once," he said.  Panicked, he joined the Greater Houston Partnership to seek out ideas, and he  got one: target marketing.  He and his small staff scrutinized every detail about the people who used the  boat and set out to find more like them. He set his sights on the corporate  client, which makes up about 70 percent of his business today. Corporate  customers include Enron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Continental Airlines and Katy  Mills mall.  "We have had our party with Star Fleet every year for five years," said Ravi  Lal, director of ethylene division of Technip, based in San Dimas, Calif.  "The first year, I wanted to do something special that I hadn't seen before.  Everybody likes it, and everybody wants to come back."  Business slowly began to build, and word spread. Lober added the 90-foot Star  Cruiser in 1997, the 74-foot Star Spirit in 1999, and brought in a fourth,  the Lake Limo, last month. Also in 1999, he bought 6 acres with 600 feet of  waterfront and built Star Fleet Marina. While part of that land is still  undeveloped, it eventually will become a parking lot for 500 cars when Lober  adds a fifth large yacht, Star Ship, sometime in the future.  "We plan to add Star Ship when we're turning down enough business from the  other boats," he said.  After more than eight years, Lober has yet to take home a salary, putting  everything back into the business.  The more he puts back, the more business he can accommodate.  But Lober and his staff still keep close tabs on their customers.  "We track everything - which individuals, what type of event, whether they  prefer sit-down dinners, how they heard about us - you name it," he said.  It's a lot of details. He knows that blackout shades, pull-down projector  screens and multiple microphone jacks are needed for presentations, and that  some clients like to be picked up at one of the Galveston hotels or other  locations on the Houston Ship Channel.  If a customer hires a deejay, a crewmember provides padding to put underneath  the CD player on the bandstand because dancing on the steel dance floor  causes the player to bounce.  Lober's three full-time cruise consultants handle charter buses to and from  the marina, limos, menus, photographers and decorations. They work with Star  Fleet's in-house florist and theme designer to provide floral arrangements  for sit-down dinners and Hawaiian leis of fresh orchids and hibiscus for a  major retailer's party, for which the florist helped transform the boat's  stanchions into palm trees.  And consultants have their own suggestions, such as bestowing captains' hats  instead of the usual corsages to employees with top sales who were being  honored at a recent floating awards banquet.  Lober believes his company's custom service brings customers back.  "They handle all the details once, and after customers go on that first  cruise, they're sold on the concept," he said. "People love something  different. We provide a different kind of party. If they do it once, they  usually want to do it again."  But cruises aren't limited to parties, Lober said. Customers have chartered  boats for banquets, retreats, new product introductions, incentive awards  dinners and for scattering loved ones' ashes.  About 60 percent of Star Fleet's business is repeat and referral. The recent  corporate party featuring the Mae West look-alike was the fifth the company  has chosen to have with Star Fleet.  Part of Lober's initial marketing problem - which continues today - is that  Houstonians just don't realize how close to the water they are.  "It's not like Fort Lauderdale, where water is part of the landscape," he  said. "In Houston, there's no high-visibility location to see the water, just  one spot on Loop 610 that overlooks the Port of Houston. Even in Clear Lake,  there are only one or two places when you drive around the lake that you can  actually see the water. We don't have a San Francisco Bay or New York Harbor.  So people have to be reminded."  He also has to deal with the misconception that only the very rich can afford  cruises, Lober said.  "Some people think they can't afford a luxury yacht, but when they compare  our complete package with upscale restaurants, hotel banquet facilities,  country clubs and wedding manors, we are quite competitive," he said. "And  our food is gourmet quality. Just like a five-star hotel, we never cut  corners."  Event cruises start at $40 per guest including food, bar, entertainment, tax  and gratuities.  Lober depends heavily on customer surveys to develop the service he and his  crew provide. And customers informally give Star Fleet staff new ideas with  some of the extras they bring aboard, such as the squirt guns, Mardi Gras  beads, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks.  "We learn a lot from our customers," he said. "We see what they do, take the  best and give it back to them."  Because customer surveys indicate that about 20 percent of Star Fleet's  business comes from being seen on the water, Lober and his captains make  their crafts as visible as possible whenever they take them out. The real  opportunity for hot-dogging comes when a customer charters two or three  boats, and they raft up to become the Star Fleet flotilla, with customers  moving from one boat to another. A three-boat charter can handle up to 375  guests.  But one boat can still do a lot of advertising.  At the recent corporate party, Mae West joined the other revelers who were  slinging Mardi Gras beads at al fresco diners as Capt. Tony DeFore edged Star  Gazer close to the Kemah waterfront. They may not have known it, but they  were doing a little of Lober's public relations work for him.  As the boat pulled back into the Star Fleet Marina, Lober pointed out a barge  under construction. When it is finished - by the end of the year, he hopes -  the bottom floor will be a galley for food preparation, the second the Star  Fleet office and the third floor an 1,800-square-foot apartment.  It will kind of resemble that three-tiered wooden box he brought home from  school years ago, Lober says.  And he's going to live at the top.   Photos: 1-2.

More power to reform agenda Soma Banerjee  05/13/2001 The Economic Times Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)  THE electricity industry is often identified as the black sheep in the  infrastructure sector which has continued to lag behind despite an overdose  of government support.  Despite being one of the earlier industries to be opened up, private  investments in this sector have failed to take off. Worse, the only sizeable project which was something to write home about  Enrons Dabhol Power plant in Maharashtra is currently a under cloud with its  promoters involved in a legal battle with the state entity and its sole  consumer for non-payment of bills. Policy makers and investors in the energy  sector are still groping to find ways and means to improve the performance of  this key industry.  Although private investments were expected to come in a big way in creating  new capacities, policy uncertainties and above all the poor financial health  of the consumer, in most cases the SEBs, have posed major problems for power  plant developers.  After about ten years of liberalisation, the private sector has to its credit  only about 5000 MW and according to projections by experts investments in  greenfield projects are unlikely before four to five years.  The factors that have been taken into consideration in the current projection  are almost inbuilt into the system. For one, there is a general agreement  that stressing on generation alone without doing much on the distribution  front has eroded the financial health of most SEBs.  ``Private power developers cannot be expected to invest in projects till they  are assured that they will be paid for the energy produced, experts say.  But like the recent Montek Singh Ahluwalia report maintains, such reforms  cannot be done overnight and will require minimum five to seven years before  they break even.  The sector has already seen major exits like Cogentrix and Powergen and if  the current trends are anything to go by it would not be long before Enron  too says Sayonara India, claim sources in the power industry.  IPPAI, an association for private power investments, feels that the flip-flop  by the government as far as power policies are concerned have made it  difficult for investors to take decisions.  ``Take this as an example at one time there were more than 200 MoUs signed up  for private power projects, the government provided counter guarantees for  eight projects, of which only three have taken off. Of this the Enron project  is already facing problems of nonpayment, says a senior source.  According to estimates drawn up by financial institutions like Power Finance  Corporation an organisation responsible for monitoring the financial health  of the SEBs and helping them with their reform programmes almost all the SEBs  have registered a negative turnover. Which is why the financing or  escrowability of SEBs across the country has been reduced to zero.  According to Union power minister Suresh Prabhu, the states are now  responsive to changes and reforms and the recent drive initiated by the  Centre to work with the state governments was expected to yield results.  But this sector has seen far too many committees which have failed to yield  much hope and it is only sheer determination of SEBs and political will that  can help this backbencher.

India Power Min: New Power Deal With Enron Unit Possible By Himendra Kumar Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  05/12/2001 Dow Jones International News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India is hopeful the Maharashtra State Electricity  Board's power purchase agreement with the U.S. energy company Enron Corp.'s  (ENE) Indian unit Dabhol Power Co. can be renegotiated and the DPC's dispute  over payments be settled, the country's federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu  said.  In a weekend interview with Dow Jones Newswires, Prabhu said the very fact  that the DPC had come to the negotiating table for discussions on its power  price was an indication that Enron was keen to save its India project. A special panel, set up by the Maharashtra state government, met with  representatives of the DPC, for the first time Friday and agreed to another  meeting May 23.  Friday's meeting lasted for more than two hours.  "I am of the view that a negotiated settlement is possible since the first  meeting of DPC with the Maharahtra state expert panel went off well. There  has been a positive response both from the DPC and the MSEB after the  meeting. The central government will also reciprocate by participating in a  meaningful dialogue. The next meeting will really decide on how it all goes,"  Prabhu said.  Earlier this week, in an e-mail to Dow Jones Newswires from Houston, Enron  Vice President John Ambler however, said, "While we have constantly  maintained that we are open to continuing a dialogue towards resolving  issues, this (Friday) meeting should in no manner be construed as an open  offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract."  The Maharashtra state government contends that the price paid for electricity  from the Dabhol power plant, India's biggest-ever foreign investment at $2.9  billion, is "unaffordable" and seeks to renegotiate tariffs.  A recent committee appointed by the government, the Godbole panel,  recommended that the power purchase agreement be renegotiated.  Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power.  Critics object to Dabhol charging 7.1 rupees ($1=INR46.8825) a kilowatt-hour  for its power, compared with INR1.5/kwh charged by other suppliers.  The 2,184-megawatt DPC project in Maharashtra has been mired in financial  disputes after the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its main customer,  failed to pay the December 2000 and January bills. The Godbole panel is  working toward lowering the DPC's power tariff and allowing the sale of  excess power to the federal government or its utilities. A restructuring of  the DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda.  The Maharashtra government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a  revised agreement within a month. The DPC currently operates a 740-megawatt  naphtha plant contributing about 0.7% to India's installed capacity. Enron  has maintained that work will be completed by the year-end in the second  phase of the Dabhol project that will add 1,444 MW to its capacity. The plant  will switch from naphtha to liquefied natural gas as a fuel source in 2002.  Texas-based Enron has a 65% stake in the DPC and is the project's largest  shareholder. Other shareholders include the MSEB with 15%, and General  Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel Enterprises (X.BTL) with 10% each.  -By Himendra Kumar, Dow Jones Newswires; 91-11-461-9427;  himendra.kumar@dowjones.com  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

India: Talks begin on Dabhol issue  05/12/2001 Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) -  Asia Intelligence Wire  MUMBAI, May 11. OFFICIALS of Enron India today met the expert committee  headed by Dr Madhav Godbole to discuss the fate of Enron's Dabhol Power  Company.  Mr A.V. Gokak, Union Government representative, who was appointed only last  night, could not attend the meeting due to the short notice. Lenders to the project who were to attend the meeting stayed away.  Instead, Mr A.G. Karkhanis, former Executive Director, Industrial Development  Bank of India, attended as observer on behalf of foreign and Indian lenders,  Mr Vinay Mohan Lal, Energy Secretary, told reporters here after the meeting.  When asked about Enron's reluctance to renegotiate, Mr Lal said: "They are  coming again on May 23. What does that mean?"  Though none of those present at the meeting was willing to give more details,  senior State Government officials had earlier told Business Line that the  State would be willing to discuss phase II only after a decision on the  rebate slapped on DPC.  "Basically our strategy will be to bring the Rs 401- crore rebate payable by  DPC to the centre-stage," the official said. "The company has not mentioned a  single word about the rebate in any of their letters to either the MSEB or  the State. And we, on the other hand, have discussed anything but the rebate  in our letters to DPC," he said.  Mr Wade Cline, Managing Director, Enron India, did not comment on whether the  company would issue the preliminary termination notice.  The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, and  Mr Lal had last evening briefed the Democratic Front constituents about their  stand vis-a-vis Enron.  They are understood to have told the political brass of the State that MSEB  does not need the second phase of the Dabhol power project.  They categorically said MSEB would not buy power from DPC-phase II, it is  learnt.  MSEB also reiterated its stand that DPC should adjust the dues owed by it  against the non-performance penalty.  Senior MSEB officials said the board had replied to the arbitration notice  issued by DPC and made its position clear. The board is of the opinion that  DPC should adjust Rs 213 crore - the December and January bills - against the  Rs 401 crore penalty for performance default.  The State Government also has backed the MSEB in its replies to the three  arbitration notices served on it. It has said that since MSEB does not accept  the charges - non-compliance with the power purchase agreement (PPA) -  leveled against it, the State is not bound to pay.  The Centre too is understood to have backed MSEB in its preliminary reply to  the conciliation notice from DPC.  Today's meeting was attended by Mr Cline, Mr Neil McGregor, President, DPC,  Mr Mukesh Tyagi, Vice-President, DPC, and Mr Sanjeev Khandekar, VP, DPC, and  Mr Mohan Gurunath, Chief Financial Officer, DPC.  Among the renegotiation panel members, Mr Deepak Parekh, Mr E A S Sarma and  Mr Kirit Parikh were also unable to attend. The next meeting is scheduled on  May 23, Mr Lal said.  Gokak nominated to panel: The Government has nominated former fertiliser and  telecom secretary, Mr A.V. Gokak, to the arbitration committee involving  Dabhol Power Company (DPC).  The Power Ministry had earlier mooted the additional solicitor general, Mr  Harish Salve's candidature for the job.  The conciliation process, however, has been hanging fire as the third  conciliator is yet to be appointed. Dabhol Power Company had written to the  Centre last month seeking six names for selection of a mutually acceptable  conciliator to kick- start the conciliation process.  DPC's letter to the Finance Ministry was seen in the context of the  substantial delay between the initiation of the conciliation process three  weeks ago and the finalisation of the conciliators. Soon after the  conciliation process was initiated, DPC decided to invoke political force  majeure and moved in for arbitration - a prelude to termination of the  project.  Our Bureau  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    India to allow 3rd party sale if DPC, MSEB jointly approach  05/12/2001 Press Trust of India Limited (c) 2001 PTI Ltd.  Mumbai, May 12 (PTI) The Federal Government will allow sale of power to a  "willing buyer" if the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) and  Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) will together approach the power  ministry with a concrete proposal for their 2,184 mw project in Dabhol.  "I will give whatever status they want, including a mega project one, if DPC  and MSEB jointly approach the Centre (Federal Government) for the same",  Indian Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told reporters here Saturday. He said the Indian Government would extend its cooperation to the Maharashtra  government (western state) "in every way" to resolve the imbroglio between  MSEB and DPC.  When pointed out that both the state government and DPC were of the opinion  that federal power utility National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) should  buy the power, Prabhu said NTPC cannot do so as it was power selling entity  and not buying one.  "There is no question of NTPC buying power from the project since long term  power purchase agreements (PPAs) have been signed by NTPC with the buying  states", he reiterated.  Prabhu said the Indian Government would also try and find out potential  buyers of DPC power "if other states were willing to buy the same".  Earlier in his meeting with state chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the  latter had suggested that NTPC sell the excess power over and above the  300-400 MW needed for the state from the 740 MW phase-I and soon to be  commissioned phase-II of 1,444 MW, to other needy states.

LOCAL STORIES DEFAZIO CALLS FOR STATE TO BUY PGE TO PROTECT RATES DAVE HOGAN AND JEFF MAPES of the Oregonian Staff  05/12/2001 Portland Oregonian SUNRISE C01 (Copyright (c) The Oregonian 2001)  Summary: The suggestion generates little enthusiasm and critics suspect it's  motivated by the lawmaker's possible race for governor  "I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can  insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business  community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale  markets." -- U.S. REP. PETER DeFAZIO D-ORE. The state of Oregon should consider buying investor-owned Portland General  Electric to help protect Oregonians from gyrations in the electricity market,  U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio declared Friday.  Gov. John Kitzhaber reacted politely and said he'll explore the idea, but  others said it's a long shot because of political, financial and timing  factors.  Critics said the proposal appeared aimed more at attracting attention to  DeFazio's potential candidacy for governor than anything else.  Several companies already are considering buying the utility, but DeFazio  said state ownership could help keep PGE customers' electricity rates low and  generate profits that could help the rest of Oregon.  "I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can  insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business  community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale  markets," said DeFazio, D-Ore.  PGE serves about 725,000 retail customers, mostly in the Portland area, and  is owned by Houston-based Enron Corp. PGE's sale to Nevada's Sierra Pacific  Resources for $3.1 billion officially fell apart last month. Other possible  buyers include Northwest Natural and ScottishPower, which owns PacifiCorp.  While Enron and PGE officials declined to comment Friday, legislative leaders  showed no particular enthusiasm for DeFazio's idea.  "I appreciate his efforts, but I don't think it's the right idea at this  time," said House Speaker Mark Simmons, R-Elgin. He said the state already  has a package of bills aimed at spurring more energy production and  conservation.  Senate President Gene Derfler, R-Salem, said he'd be willing to sit down and  talk with DeFazio. "I would not just shut the door," he said, but he doesn't  plan to devote much work to the proposal. Derfler questioned whether state  government could run a utility as efficiently as a business.  DeFazio said a PGE purchase would offer several benefits. State ownership  would put control of PGE in local hands instead of those of a faraway  corporation such as ScottishPower. For PGE customers, state ownership would  provide some protection and stability in electricity rates. It also would be  a good investment that would pay for itself and perhaps pump revenue back  into the state's coffers.  The purchase could be financed with tax-exempt bonds sold by the state.  DeFazio said state Treasurer Randall Edwards had told him the idea was "in  the realm of possibility."  DeFazio's idea is an intriguing one and could provide some benefits, said Bob  Jenks, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board, which represents  customers of investor-owned utilities such as PGE.  Jenks said the primary benefit would be that, if the state bought PGE, the  utility would be able to buy lower-priced electricity from the Bonneville  Power Administration, which is required to sell power at lower rates to  publicly owned utilities. However, a publicly owned PGE wouldn't be able to  buy the lower-priced BPA power for about five years because of electricity  sales contracts that already are in place.  And even if PGE were able to buy lower-priced BPA power, that wouldn't  necessarily translate to lower electricity bills for PGE customers, Jenks  said. In addition, he said it could increase rates for other publicly owned  utilities because the BPA has a shortage of cheap hydropower.  The state Public Utility Commission would have to approve any sale of PGE,  but outgoing PUC Chairman Ron Eachus criticized DeFazio's proposal, saying it  had the potential to increase rates both for PGE customers and for publicly  owned utilities. He also said it seemed designed to get political attention  for DeFazio's potential candidacy.  "I think we're in the political season where people are proposing grandiose  schemes that aren't very well thought out, and this seems to be one of  those," Eachus said.  DeFazio conceded that a high-profile proposal focused on a Portland-area  issue such as the ownership of PGE would be a good way for a candidate to  build support for a run for governor, but he said that had nothing to do with  his plan.

Congressman suggests state buy PGE By CHARLES E. BEGGS Associated Press Writer  05/11/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.  SALEM, Ore. (AP) - Congressman Peter DeFazio on Friday proposed that the  state buy Portland General Electric as a way to hold down power costs.  The Democrat outlined his plan after presenting it to Gov. John Kitzhaber,  who said he would ask his energy advisers to analyze it. PGE is Oregon's biggest electric utility, serving more than 700,000  customers. DeFazio said a state purchase of the company could insulate many  Oregonians from "the craziness in power markets."  DeFazio said the state could buy the company by issuing revenue bonds and  have the utility operate as a public power entity.  He said the purchase would give the state a diverse mix of transmission  rights along with hydropower, gas, coal and renewable energy sources.  "While I have not exhaustively researched the proposal, it does appear to be  feasible," said DeFazio, an opponent of electric deregulation.  Enron Corp., the Texas-based owner of PGE, is trying to sell the utility.  Sierra Pacific last month abandoned its plan to buy PGE for $3.1 billion,  citing increasing difficulties in the current market and the political  environment in the West.  Kitzhaber said he's not opposed to the idea of the state buying a private  utility, as long as it would benefit consumers.  DeFazio said PGE has been a profitable company, and putting it in public  ownership could give it preference over private utilities for the Bonneville  Power Administration's hydropower.  The congressman's suggestion wasn't welcomed by the Legislature.  "Thanks, but no thanks," said House Speaker Mark Simmons.  "Philosophically, I think it's the wrong approach," he said. "We have a  bipartisan package of bills dealing with the issue."  Among those are his measure to delay partial electric deregulation for large  businesses and a bill to speed up the process for siting temporary generating  plants.  Senate President Gene Derfler didn't reject the idea, but said the  Legislature doesn't have enough time in the current session to take on a job  like a utility purchase.

NEW YORK -- After more than two years of talks, Saudi Arabia is about to  announce its choice of international oil companies for three huge natural-gas  projects that will mark a reopening of the kingdom's energy sector to Western  investment, a quarter century after it was nationalized.  But the announcement, and the signing of memorandums of understanding early  next month, will mark only the beginning of serious negotiations on terms for  the three ventures, which together will need investment of some $25 billion.  It will be months before final agreements are signed. "We expect to have an agreement -- a final agreement -- signed somewhere at  the end of the year, or, hopefully, the first quarter of next year," said  Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi in an interview last week.  Saudi Arabia's 11-member Supreme Petroleum Council is expected to meet today  to endorse the companies recommended by a ministerial committee led by  Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. In the following week, Saudi Arabia  is expected to communicate its decision to the oil companies from both sides  of the Atlantic that have been vying for a role in the three projects. By the  end of the month, the chosen consortium members and Saudi officials are  expected to agree on which three companies will lead the projects. This will  be a prestigious role in a country that is the world's largest oil exporter,  has more than a quarter of the world's oil reserves and has the fifth-largest  reserves of natural gas.  As with any negotiations for such huge projects, industry rumors abound. All  three so-called oil supermajors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch/Shell Group  and BP PLC -- have been mentioned as project leaders, particularly for the  plum Ghawar project, named after the world's largest onshore oil field, whose  environs are expected to yield large volumes of gas. The Ghawar project,  known as Core Venture 1, is projected to require about $15 billion in  investment. Core Venture 2 is on the Red Sea coast. The third project is in  Shaybah, a recently developed oil field in the kingdom's Empty Quarter, a  southeastern region bordering the United Arab Emirates.  The companies say they have no idea who will be named to the consortia, or  who the Saudis will choose from a short list of 11 companies -- Exxon Mobil,  Shell, BP, Chevron Corp., TotalFinaElf SA, ENI SpA, Enron Corp., Occidental  Petroleum Corp., Marathon Oil Canada Inc., Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum  Corp. -- to lead each project. But they all have their hopes.  "We would be very disappointed if we are not the lead operator" for the  Shaybah project, said Archie Dunham, Conoco's chairman and chief executive.  Since Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah invited major oil companies to return to  the kingdom in October 1998, negotiations have focused on such broad issues  as the scope of the projects and their integrated nature -- from exploration  and production of gas to the making of petrochemicals and electricity -- as  well as the notion that the companies will need adequate returns on their  investment.  Soon, the project leaders will have to start the bargaining on such issues as  the roles to be played by national champions Aramco and petrochemicals  company Saudi Basic Industries Corp.  ---  Alexei Barrionuevo in Houston contributed to this article.  --- Population Pressure  Saudi Arabia is opening up its energy sector, in a bid to bolster the  economy as population grows  -- Population 21.3 million (growing over 3.5% per year)  -- Unemployment rate* 27%-35% of males  -- Real GDP Growth Rate 7.6%  -- Oil Production 9.3 million barrels per day  -- Natural-Gas Reserves 204.5 trillion cubic feet  -- Natural-Gas Production/Consumption 1.68 trillion cubic feet  *Unofficial estimate for 1999  Note: Figures are estimates for 2000 except natural-gas production, which is for 1999  Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.  WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House team developing a national energy plan has  met with more than 130 interest groups, from environmentalists and unions  often at odds with Republicans to major Bush supporters given private  sessions with Vice President Dick Cheney.  The vice president, Cabinet secretaries and others on a special task force  have solicited ideas behind closed doors, hoping the privacy would encourage  a free exchange of ideas. The White House has declined to provide names of participants - even to  Congress.  But interviews with participants detail a massive outreach where diverse  interests have met with task force executive director Andrew Lundquist.  Cheney's time has been reserved for meetings with more select participants  such as power wholesaler Enron Corp. and the Edison Electric Institute, both  GOP donors.  Houston-based Enron is the world's top buyer and seller of natural gas and  electricity.  "The way the task force is set up, they don't have the staff or time to have  a huge host of companies come through the door. They have told us to work  through our associations to the extent we can," said Don Duncan, vice  president of government relations for Phillips Petroleum Co.  Participants said the meetings, typically 20 minutes to 45 minutes, included  about a dozen to 100 interest group members and a few task force members and  staff.  No details were disclosed. Instead, administration representatives summarized  the nation's energy problems or listened as groups briefly offered background  and proposals. Many sent detailed materials to the task force outlining their  priorities.  At a half-hour meeting in late March with White House strategist Karl Rove  and Bush economic adviser Larry Lindsey, nuclear energy executives tried to  make sure the two knew about the production records the industry has set over  the past few years. At one point, Rove asked if anyone was looking to build a  nuclear power plant. An executive with Exelon replied that his company was  thinking about it, meeting participants said.  Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham has attended several meetings, including one  with Teamsters President James Hoffa and an hourlong session in California  with Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, who contends the administration has done  little to help the power-strapped state.  Like other governors, Davis was asked to provide one page on the state's  power crisis, including a description of the problem, an anecdote about it  and possible solutions.  "They're asking for a one-page memo on possibly the biggest crisis ever  affecting the state, with a massive ripple effect for the nation," Davis  spokesman Steve Maviglio said. "I think it demands more attention than a  one-page memo."  Cheney spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said the task force has been  studying the California problem almost daily.  At a meeting between Abraham and about 100 coal industry representatives in  late April, task force staffers handed out a briefing packet that outlined  national energy needs, and then they listened to industry proposals.  "I thought the purpose was one, to reassure people in the coal industry that  coal was going to play a large role in the energy mix, and essentially when  the plan is unveiled that they're going to be looking to people to help  martial this through Congress," said Bill Banig, a lobbyist for the United  Mineworkers Union.  White House officials said the meetings are not designed to encourage  lobbying and that task force members were carefully instructed on what was  permissible under federal law.  Cheney's meetings included Enron, Edison Electric Institute, California  Republicans, and the senators from Nevada, home to the proposed Yucca  Mountain federal nuclear waste site. The vice president plans to meet with  the renewable-energy industry this week.  Enron ranked among Bush's top 10 presidential campaign contributors, giving  more than $110,000, and helped sponsor a $7 million party fund-raiser last  month.  The Edison Electric Institute gave Republican candidates more than two-thirds  of its $193,000 in contributions last year. Edison International, whose  holdings include the Southern California Edison electric utility, is also a  major donor, giving $535,000 to Republicans last year and $330,000 to  Democrats.  Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said Cheney met with Enron executives because the  power wholesaler is a respected member of the industry, not because it was a  contributor. Enron wants the administration's energy plan to ease electricity  transmission bottlenecks, give companies incentives to invest in new  transmission and make the wholesale power market as open as possible, he  said.  Tom Kuhn, the institute's president, said it is "totally ludicrous" to think  political donations played a role.  Cheney's meeting with Edison board members, held at the institute's  invitation, lasted 15 minutes to 20 minutes. Cheney spoke about the task  force process, Kuhn said. He said Cheney's remarks were consistent with the  vice president's public statements.  Edison wants to see new generation and transmission systems built, including  coal, natural gas and nuclear and hydroelectric power, Kuhn said.  Democrats in Congress sought a list of participants in the meetings, but  Cheney's office responded by only listing broad categories and no names. That  has left fodder for political attack.  "You can't just take advice from one interest group or set of interest groups  when you do these things," said Dave Albersworth of the Wilderness Society,  whose group has met with Lundquist but was denied its request to talk with  Cheney.  Weiss countered that the energy task force has collected information from  more than 130 groups since January in an "almost Herculean effort" to draw  input from all sides.  "People deserve the right to petition their government and not expect a full  laundry list of who's called to be announced," she said.  Enron spokesman Palmer said he is not seeking such privacy. "I'm happy to  tell people what we're advocating for. I'd rather be talking about policy  than about politics," he said.  ---  On the Net:  White House Energy Task Force:  http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud10.html  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

COMPANIES & FINANCE UK: Independents drill deep to strike rich seams: A new  generation of smaller oil companies is emerging; a group that has discovered  how to be competitive, writes David Buchan: Financial Times; May 14, 2001 By DAVID BUCHAN  		The UK's listed small oil companies may have dwindled in number. But they can  rightly say, echoing Mark Twain's words, that reports of their collective  demise are exaggerated.  		Indeed, many in the UK-based exploration and production companies, dubbed  "independents" in the sense of being untied to any refining and marketing,  believe they have more of a role than when their kind first started operating  in the North Sea 30 years ago.  		After the takeovers in recent years of Lasmo, Monument and British Borneo,  there may only be about a dozen significant UK-based "independents" left. Yet  they amount to virtually the entire European E&P sector: the only significant  exception being Lundin Oil of Sweden.  		Many of the UK independents began life as local partners of US companies in  the 1970s when the Labour government of the period gave preference to  consortia with a local flavour.  		But this rationale disappeared when the Thatcher government took a more  free-for-all approach to letting anyone develop the North Sea - though at the  same time it did create the biggest UK independent by floating off British  Gas' oil interests as Enterprise Oil. Enterprise is the only UK independent  that is more than a niche or regional player. As such its E&P assets would be  a significant addition to an oil major, hence the persistently rumoured  interest in taking it over.  		As the North Sea became more competitive and difficult, some of the UK-based  independents began to look elsewhere. "Unlike US independents which have  always tended to be less interested in drilling outside North America, those  in the UK have always tended to be more sympathetic to exotic parts of the  world", says Mark Redway of Teather and Greenwood.  		Unfortunately, the obvious exotic new province that happened to open up in  the early 1990s was the former Soviet Union. One company, Ramco Energy,  dipped in and out very successfully, recently selling its 2 per cent stake in  the Azerbaijan International Oil Consortium for Dollars 150m (Pounds 104.8m).  		Other UK independents - Aminex, Soco and Dana Petroleum - ventured into  Russia and got stuck. While Aminex finds it hard to downplay Russia (because  it has little elsewhere), Soco these days stresses its Mongolia and Vietnam  operations. Another UK independent, JKX Oil & Gas, went into Ukraine, a  country notorious for non-payment of energy bills. With diplomatic help from  Tony Blair, the prime minister, JKX has just survived a legal attempt to rob  it of its Ukraine assets.  		Two other independents have sunk more fruitful roots in Asia. "Cairn Energy  now has as big a stake in Bangladesh's gas production as Shell, and it would  be left, if Enron (the US energy company) were to quit India, as the biggest  foreign player in India," says Iain Reid of UBS Warburg. Premier Oil is now a  substantial Asian gas company, with production in Burma, Indonesia and  Pakistan and long term contracts in Thailand and Singapore.  		But there are risks in these Asian ties. The obvious political one concerns  Burma. Last year the UK government asked Premier to quit Burma because its  presence was helping the military regime. Premier refused, and said it would  carry on.  		The other risk, according to Mr Redway, is economic and it applies also to  Cairn. Because there is no real world market for gas, Cairn and Premier are  "very dependent on the strength of the local economies". But then, Mr Redway  is an analyst who believes that independents' competitive edge lies in  exploration rather than production. He therefore rates Fusion Oil & Gas  highly as "the purest exploration investment opportunity in the E&P sector".  		Dana similarly vaunts its exploration expertise, but to a different end. Its  goal, according to Tom Cross, chief executive, is to find oil and then swap  exploration for production assets. "This avoids the expensive development  stage of building platforms and pipelines and so on". Then at the other end  of the spectrum are production-focused companies, such as Paladin, Tullow Oil  or Venture Production. Roy Franklin, Paladin's chief executive, makes no  bones about his company's scavenger strategy, spotting rich pickings  overlooked by the majors.  		The majors are not always ready to sell, particularly recently when the oil  price rise has widened the gap in price expectations between buyers and  sellers.  		But Paladin was last year able to buy PetroCanada's assets in Norway, and is  this year interested in bidding for some of what the Norwegian state is  selling off.  		As its name suggests, Venture Production, a private Aberdeen-based company  with North Sea and Trinidad operations, is focused on extraction, not  exploration. And so are other private companies such as Intrepid, Consort  Energy and Highland Energy, formed in the past three or four years. This new  generation of company tends to be more cautious than the older one.  "Exploration has probably been the best way to destroy shareholder value,"  says one executive.  		The other risk the new oilmen want to avoid is the vagaries of the stock  market. "By focusing on production, the new companies are more predictable in  terms of cash flow and earnings," says Mike Wagstaff, Venture's finance  director.  		Copyright: The Financial Times Limited  		 		    News Bush energy team covers all the bases Sharon Theimer, Associated Press  05/14/2001 Chicago Tribune North Sports Final ; N 13 (Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune)  The White House team developing a national energy plan has met with more than  130 interest groups, from environmentalists and unions often at odds with  Republicans to major Bush supporters.  Vice President Dick Cheney, Cabinet secretaries and others have solicited  ideas behind closed doors, hoping the privacy would encourage a free exchange  of ideas. The White House has declined to provide names of participants even to  Congress.  But interviews with participants detail an outreach program where diverse  interests have met with task force executive director Andrew Lundquist.  Cheney's time has been reserved for meetings with more select participants  such as power wholesaler Enron Corp. and the Edison Electric Institute, both  GOP donors.  "The way the task force is set up, they don't have the staff or time to have  a huge host of companies come through the door. They have told us to work  through our associations to the extent we can," said Don Duncan, vice  president of government relations for Phillips Petroleum Co.  Participants said the meetings, typically 20 minutes to 45 minutes, included  a dozen to 100 interest group members and a few task force members and staff.  No details were disclosed. Instead, administration representatives summarized  the nation's energy problems or listened as groups briefly offered background  and proposals. Many sent detailed materials to the task force outlining  priorities.  Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham has attended several meetings, including one  with Teamsters President James Hoffa and an hourlong session in California  with Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, who contends the administration has done  little to help the power-strapped state.  Like other governors, Davis was asked to provide one page on the state's  power crisis, including a description of the problem, an anecdote about it  and possible solutions.  "They're asking for a one-page memo on possibly the biggest crisis ever  affecting the state, with a massive ripple effect for the nation," Davis  spokesman Steve Maviglio said. "I think it demands more attention than a  one-page memo."  Cheney spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said the task force has been  studying the California problem almost daily.  At a meeting between Abraham and 100 coal industry representatives in late  April, task force staffers handed out a briefing packet that outlined  national energy needs, and then they listened to industry proposals.  "I thought the purpose was one, to reassure people in the coal industry that  coal was going to play a large role in the energy mix, and essentially when  the plan is unveiled that they're going to be looking to people to help  marshal this through Congress," said Bill Banig, a lobbyist for the United  Mineworkers Union.  White House officials said the meetings are not designed to encourage  lobbying.  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.      QATAR: UAE's Dolphin may seek new partners if Enron exits. By Kedar Sharma  05/14/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.  DOHA, May 14 (Reuters) - Dolphin Energy Ltd (DEL) may invite new foreign  investors to join its project to route Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates  as U.S. Enron Corp looks set to bow out, industry sources said on Monday.  "New partners are a possibility," Khaldoun al-Mubarak, project manager for  DEL, majority owned by the UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), told Reuters. "But at the moment we are in the midst of finalising the formal (development  and production sharing) agreement with Qatar which should be done by  September at the latest."  Qatar and DEL in March signed a "commercial term sheet agreement" which  outlined the conditions of the upstream agreement for the long-awaited $3.5  billion project.  UOG currently owns 51 percent of DEL, with the remainder held equally by  France's TotalFinaElf and Enron.  "Enron is going through major global restructuring," Mubarak said. "(But)  they haven't officially notified us about their intention to pull out."  Enron officials declined comment.  Mubarak said interest in DEL was running high.  "Everyone is asking for a stake," he said.  The gas deal would entitle DEL to develop a tract of Qatar's giant North  Field and produce up to two billion cubic feet per day (cfd) of gas.  UOG is to invest $2 billion in developing the North Field tract, drilling and  setting up production facilities.  The remaining $1.5 billion would be invested to lay a pipeline and set up  receiving terminals at Dubai's Jebel Ali and Taweelah in Abu Dhabi.  First gas is targeted to reach the UAE capital Abu Dhabi by late 2004 or  early 2005. About one billion to 1.5 billion cfd of Qatari gas would be  consumed by utilities in Abu Dhabi with the remainder supplied to Dubai.  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.     UAE: UPDATE 1-Saudi expected to name gas race winners on Tuesday. By Peg Mackey  05/14/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.  DUBAI, May 14 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is  expected to meet on Tuesday and announce the oil majors chosen for its  multi-billion dollar gas investment opening, industry sources familiar with  the negotiations said on Monday.  The sources said the SPC is expected to name ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell  as lead players in three so-called core projects involving the kingdom's  upstream gas sector - off-limits to foreign oil firms since nationalisation  in 1975. Signing of memoranda of understanding (MOUs) would most probably take place  in early June, the sources said.  The anticipated announcement would mark the biggest advance in the kingdom's  gas initiative, valued at an initial $25 billion, since Riyadh unveiled its  energy investment opening over two years ago.  But the hard work has yet to start on the opening of Saudi Arabia's gas  sector, the world's fourth biggest. "The fiscal regime and regulatory details  have not been developed," said one source.  FINAL CUT  Riyadh is expected to trim back its original shortlist of 11 potential  foreign investors revealed last summer. Those companies had been grouped  under three core venture consortia - South Ghawar, Red Sea and Shaybah.  For ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell, securing the lead role in Saudi  Arabia's core ventures would entitle them to operate the package and get the  biggest slice of the projects, analysts said.  Other industry sources said ExxonMobil, the world's biggest energy company,  was tipped for the top slot in core venture 1 (South Ghawar) as well as in  core venture 2 (Red Sea).  Royal Dutch/Shell was in pole position for core venture 3 (Shaybah), the  sources added.  Both oil supermajors already have significant foreign investment in the  kingdom and feature as top customers of Saudi oil, the analysts said.  ENERGY DRIVERS  An urgent need to create jobs and grow the economy are driving Saudi Arabia's  landmark energy opening.  And analysts said big oil companies were prepared to help the kingdom achieve  those aims even if the return on their investment was relatively low.  "Major oil companies just cannot miss this opportunity," a source said. "The  gas projects will show profits."  But just how much revenue oil companies will generate by selling water and  electricity in the Saudi domestic market remains to be seen.  On paper, at least, the kingdom's domestic gas sector looks set for  impressive growth.  Domestic gas demand, now running at about 3.4 billion cubic feet per day, is  forecast to grow at more than seven percent a year over the coming decade.  Saudi Arabia has meanwhile made clear that its prized oil sector, the world's  biggest, remains off limits.  Even so, oil companies still hold out hope for eventual involvement in oil,  the kingdom's lifeblood.  "The companies are just as happy with gas, but oil remains the ultimate  objective," a regional analyst said.  "Saudi Aramco is still putting up strong defence barriers, but eventually  they could open up the oil sector once they feel comfortable working with the  majors."  The Saudi gas initiative seeks foreign oil companies' help in developing the  kingdom's known gas reserves as well as investment in downstream projects fed  by gas supplies, such as power and desalination.  The following companies have been shortlisted for the gas projects:  Core venture 1 (South Ghawar Area) - ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP ,  TotalFinaElf , Chevron and ENI .  Core venture 2 (Red Sea Area) - TotalFinaElf, ExxonMobil, Marathon , Enron /Oxy , Conoco , Royal Dutch/Shell.  Core venture 3 (Shaybah Area) - Royal Dutch/Shell, ExxonMobil, Marathon,  Conoco, TotalFinaElf, Phillips and Enron/Oxy.  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    Saudi Oil Council To Meet Tue On Gas Projects -Sources  05/14/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- International oil companies vying for a stake in Saudi  Arabia's downstream gas projects, expect to be notified soon on whether they  have been selected to participate, industry sources in the kingdom said  Monday.  Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council is set to meet Tuesday and shortly  after, announce its final selection for each of the three core ventures on  offer, the sources said. The Saudi Arabian committee negotiating with international oil companies on  the Gas Initiative, submitted its proposals for consortium members and  leaders to the country's Ministerial Council in April. These were then passed  on to the SPC for final approval.  Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah, who heads the SPC, is in Bahrain Monday  attending a Gulf Cooperation Council leaders' summit along with Saudi  Arabia's foreign minister, Saud Al Faisal, who heads the gas negotiating  committee.  Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to  participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas  enhancement.  After a series of meetings between the negotiating committee and IOC's in the  past year, the following companies were shortlisted for each project.  Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron  Corp. (CHV), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and ENI SpA (E) for Core Venture 1,  the $15 billion South Ghawar Area Development.  For Core Venture 2, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental  Petroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and Exxon Mobil, Total Fina Elf,  Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) were listed.  And for Core Venture 3, the Shaybah area, Total Fina Elf, Conoco, Phillips  Petroleum (P), Enron and Occidental, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Marathon Oil were  listed.   With all those shortlisted expected to play some role, the immediate and  essential question for each of the IOC's is whether they will be selected to  lead and operate a project, with Core Venture 1 the most sought after,  industry sources said.  Exxon Mobil and Shell have been tipped as frontrunners for this venture.  The operator's role will be more crucial than ever here as it will be  responsible for directing further negotiations on the projects at hand which  will lead to final deals probably by year end.  Also, operators are expected to decide and direct how the project's  individual and large components will be developed, details the Saudis haven't  finalized, sources said.  The three ventures have been estimated at a combined value of about $25  billion.  -By Dyala Sabbagh, Dow Jones Newswires; 9714-331-4260;  dyala.sabbagh@dowjones.com  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    Business RFID chip will help speed up business  05/14/2001 The New Straits Times Main/Lifestyle; 2* 26 (Copyright 2001)  THE combination of recently developed "stick-on" Radio Frequency  Identification (RFID) chip technology with a global positioning system (GSP)  will transform and quicken the pace of doing business in the oil and gas  industry.  And Malaysia must adapt to this shift to maintain her global positioning. Global management and technology consultant Global Energy Strategy Practice  which is working in partnership with Accenture Sdn Bhd wants to promote this  idea locally.  Global Energy Strategy Practice partner Paul Spence said that applying this  latest combined technology, car owners can fill up a petrol tank without  resorting to human contact or to the use of a credit card.  Relevant personal data embedded in the RFID chip would be machine read and  the required quantity of petrol delivered, as if right out of a science  fiction movie.  This surreal development is made possible through the application of  ubiquitous-commerce (u-commerce) whereby computers and machines communicate  with each other to affect an impression of an omnipresent intelligence.  Such technology is economically available today. "There are technology  suppliers who are offering these capabilities."  The technology also has applications outside the oil and gas industry.  Communications between machines can now allow or deny access of individuals  to restricted zones.  In an interview in Petaling Jaya recently, Spence said: "A lot of my clients  now are asking, whether that same technology can be used to restrict access  into hazardous areas, plants or production sites.  "Can a warning alarm be fitted to the individual or to an assistant? There  are lots of safety, health and environment applications around that."  "Guru in the field" is another potential application where a combination of  RFID chips, video cameras, personal digital assistants (PDA) and personal  computers can deliver distant technical advice on- site.  "An industry client operating in the North Sea oil fields has a prototype  mounted on a workman's helmet which sends snap-shots to experts on the other  side of the world.  "The effect of this new combined technology on global financial and commodity  markets is to lock them in tighter correlation.  "The days of being able to arbitrage for profits between geographical markets  are shortening within the energy industry. Enron which is the biggest oil  trader in the US is now hedging on weather derivatives."  Accenture partner Lim Beng Choon said that to compete globally, the oil and  gas industry in Malaysia would have to implement this new technology to  remain connected to global markets.

India: Godbole panel report may suggest MSEB bifurcation  05/14/2001 Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) -  Asia Intelligence Wire  MUMBAI, May 13. THE second part of the Dr Madhav Godbole committee report is  expected to be submitted to the State Government on May 15.  While the first part of the report recommended renegotiation of the power  purchase agreement with Enron's Dabhol Power Company, the second part is  expected to suggest bifurcation of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board,  sources said. The committee, which has been given the mandate to negotiate  with Enron officials to make DPC power more acceptable, had a marathon  meeting on May 11 to finalise the second half of the report. "The committee has been considering the bifurcation of MSEB," a source said.  "The idea is to try and separate the distribution from generation and  transmission." While generation and transmission can be controlled by the  State, there may be a suggestion to privatise the distribution arm. Over 1.5  lakh MSEB employees had gone on a strike to oppose a Bill to unbundle the  board into three divisions - generation, transmission and distribution - due  to fear of privatisation.  MSEB, the State's leading power company, has been facing huge losses due to  delay in payments and theft of power. The second part of the report is  expected to address the problem in detail.  Part one of the report submitted on April 10 had said: "...none of the  solutions espoused for independent power producers, in general, and DPC, in  particular, is tenable without the reforms of MSEB, especially its  distribution business, which it shall address in part II of the report."  The report is expected to "suggest appropriate measures to ensure that the  interests of the State, MSEB and electricity consumers of the State of  Maharashtra are properly and adequately considered, evaluated and  safeguarded," according to the terms of reference laid down when forming the  committee.  The committee originally consisted of Dr Madhav Godbole, Mr Deepak Parekh, Dr  E.A.S. Sarma, Dr Rajendra Pachauri and the State Energy Secretary, Mr Vinay  Mohan Lal. The MSEB Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, has been inducted as part of  the panel after the submission of the first part and before the beginning of  negotiations with Enron.  Archana Chaudhary  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    The Smart Investor Tertiary will be primary Indira Vergis  05/14/2001 Business Standard 2 Copyright (c) Business Standard  These are volatile times for world business. There are increasing jitters  that a slowing US economy could dampen prospects for the global economies.  Many developing regions, especially in Asia, are bracing themselves for a  bout of slightly lower growth.  But two countries, India and China which together account for about half the  region's gross domestic product (GDP_ will still continue to see their GDP  grow at six per cent, forecasts the Asian Development Bank. Many Indian economists agree with ADB's projections. In fact, they view the  prediction of a six per cent growth in India's GDP as benign. Nearly 54 per  cent of India's GDP is delivered by its services sector and a modest  performance by this sector, some economists say, will be enough to hold up  the GDP at six per cent. There are others who hope that better agricultural  performance could prompt the economy to hand in a better scorecard.  However, the Indian industry remains trapped in the doldrums, suffering from  a lack of consumer confidence and investments. Very few economists expect to  see signs of recovery sprouting any time soon.  An interest rate cut is considered vital by many to energise the sector. And,  they argue, there are certain economic indicators that encourage such a move.  Inflation is running at very low levels and the nation's foreign exchange  reserves are currently high enough to provide a strong defence to the Indian  currency. Surprisingly, our trade balance, which threatened to spiral out of  control by surging oil prices last year, has been contained. Since then, oil  prices have retreated and are expected to remain subdued. While a rate cut  may go some way in reviving sentiment and activity in the industrial sector,  stirring up consumer demand will still hinge on a normal monsoon.  Rain, rain, come again  For many economists, the prediction of India clinging to its current GDP  level is heavily contingent on a normal spell of monsoon this year.  "According to our assessment, we believe the Indian economy will grow by  around 6.5 per cent this fiscal year," says Chetan Ahya, vice president at J  M Morgan Stanley Securities.  In 2000-01, agricultural growth withered under a poor monsoon and a  subsequent drought in many parts of the country. For the second year in a  row, growth in the sector sank below one per cent. It stood at 0.9 per cent  compared with 0.7 per cent the previous year. While agriculture accounts for  only 24 per cent of GDP, it remains the most keenly-watched sector by  economists. "The performance of the agricultural sector is important because  of its linkages to the economy both on the supply side and on the consumption  side," says Mohan Nagarajan, chief economist at Credit Analysis and Research  Ltd (CARE). "It would lead to a better performance of agro-based industries,"  he adds.  More significantly, roughly 60 per cent of Indians still depend on  agriculture for their livelihood. "A good crop means that demand for  everything, from everyday use goods like toothpaste to larger items like  tractors will pick up," says Nagarajan. Economists are hoping that a good  monsoon will budge growth in the sector to around 1.5 to 2.5 per cent.  In service of the economy  Another key sector economists will be watching out for will be services.  India's services sector ranging from finance, insurance, hospitality to  transportation and communication slowed its pace in 2000-01. With growth  weakening by a whole per cent to 8.4 in 2000-01, sluggishness in this  important sector has been blamed for dragging down the overall GDP. Most  economists expect the sector to post either relatively flat growth or edge  slightly higher this year. But, it's performance will be vital to ensure that  overall GDP holds at six per cent. "Even if the agriculture and industry  numbers fall again but services sees even seven to eight per cent growth, it  will be enough to keep the GDP around six per cent," says Nagarajan.  Construction activity a services component that includes housing, roads and  other infrastructure projects demonstrated surprisingly good growth of 8.7  per cent and is expected to maintain the pace. Road construction is tipped to  show increasing levels of activity as work on the ambitious highway linking  Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Calcutta intensifies.  Chiming in will be the housing industry, benefiting in recent years from tax  reliefs and attractive financing schemes, and which have encouraged more  people to buy houses.  Another segment slated to witness good growth will be IT-enabled services,  says Morgan Stanley's Ahya. "We are emerging as the services workshop of the  world," he says. IT-enabled services like call centres and data processing,  though currently generating tiny revenues, are slated to turn into big money  spinners in the years ahead.  The telecommunications industry will also see improving levels of investment.  "The penetration of services is so low, that it has an intrinsic high growth  rate," says Ahya. For a taste of the market, consider this: out of the 100  Indians, only one uses the Internet and less than three own a telephone.  A good home show  And there could be a pleasant surprise in store for industry amid all the  gloom over its performance.  Adequate liquidity conditions are spurring expectations of a cut in interest  rates. Broad money(M3) a gauge of total money available in the economy  increased 16.2 per cent in 2000-01 against 14.6 per cent last year.  While the Reserve Bank of India had cut the bank rate in March, the belief is  that a further cut of 50 basis points is imminent. The bank rate the rate at  which the central bank lends to commercial banks currently stands at seven  per cent. Aiding the cause is the inflation data which shows the wholesale  price index at a tame 5.84 per cent. With economists betting that oil prices  will remain in the $24-28 a barrel range, inflation is not expected to  exhibit the oil price-inspired gyrations of last year. A cut could coax the  industry to step up activity, though admittedly, much would still depend on  rural demand.  Neighbours' envy  And while many Asian countries watch with increasing nervousness the impact  of an American downturn on their economies, India and China can afford to  remain relatively placid about global developments. That's because they are  less dependent on the US for their own economic health. That is expected to  shield them somewhat from being blown off-course like some other Asian  nations by the ill-wind of an American slump in demand.  With exports making up less than 10 per cent of India's GDP, its economy is  clearly not export-driven. In contrast, nearly 35 per cent of Indonesia's GDP  comes from exports, 57 per cent for Thailand, and 50 per cent for the  Philippines.  Yet, despite claiming only a small percentage of GDP, India's exports  remained a bright spot amid some gloomy economic data. Exports raced ahead 20  per cent to $44.1 billion in 2000-01. It was the second consecutive year of  good exports growth. On the flip side, imports rose, too, during the same  period to Rs $49.1 billion. But non-oil imports, however, declined 15 per  cent to $34.2 billion. That helped narrow the trade gap to $5.74 billion from  $12.79 billion the previous year.  Still, India can ill-afford to ignore completely the risks of an American  slump in demand. The US is India's largest trading partner and, in 2000-01, a  quarter of its exports headed to that nation. Besides, by taking in nearly 70  per cent of India's software exports, it is also India's most important  software exports destination.  Booming software exports accompanied by remittances by Indians living  overseas have been the primary factors exerting a calming influence on  India's balance of payments of position, especially in times of economic  turbulence. For example, last year, while a surging oil import bill  threatened to rattle the nation's trade gap, inflows from  invisibles(including income from software and Indians living abroad) came to  the rescue helping India limit its overall current account deficit.  It's a sobering realisation that has compelled the National Association of  Software and Service Companies(NASSCOM) to lower its exports forecast to  between $8.5 billion to $9 billion from its previous figure of $9.5 billion.  Earlier, it had also revised estimates for 2000-01 lower to $6.2 billion from  $6.3 billion. Still, observers say it isn't a cause for depression.  "They are still talking about growth. It is a decline in the growth rate and  not an actual downturn itself," points out John Band, chief executive  officer, ASK-Raymond James and Associates. And remittances look set to  maintain their pace as well. "Most remittances are still from Indians who  live in the Middle East, and I don't see any slowdown from this segment,"  says CARE's Nagarajan. Remittances totalled $9.8 billion in the nine months  to December 2000. Software exports brought in $4.6 billion during the same  period.  Foreign institutions support  Another recent 'feel-good' sign has been evident in the stock markets too.  Between January and April 2001, eigners poured in Rs 7,368 crore into India's  equity markets - a phenomenal 15 per cent more than what they invested in the  whole of calendar 2000.  Yet, experts aren't reading too much into it. In the past few months,  investors have been fleeing from a shower of profit warnings in the US and  seeking cover in alternative investments. As they rejuggle their portfolios,  some money will inevitably flow into India and other countries, experts say.  Because it isn't affected so much by what's happening externally, they see  India as some kind of a safe haven," says ASK's Band.  Yet some hesitation  Recently, gunning for more foreign direct investments (FDI), the government  opened more sectors for foreign and private participation, including  pharmaceuticals, hotels, banking and astonishingly, even defence. However,  tempting FDI has always been a vexing issue for India.  In 2000-01, FDI did improve slightly, moving 26 per cent higher than the  previous year to $2.4 billion. Yet, China a market India is frequently  compared with in terms of size and potential attracted 20 times more FDI in  the same period. Economists now shrug off FDI as a tool to kick-start  investment in the country. "It's a pittance and it probably will remain  stagnant," says an economist at a foreign research house.  The reasons are not hard to find. Foreigners seeking to invest in India have  many fences to cross. Frequent changes in sector policies, chaotic  infrastructure facilities and nightmarish bureaucratic redtape have often  left foreigners tired and wary of doing business in India.  The stress of investing in India is most clearly visible in the recurring  concerns that have stubbornly dogged US energy giant Enron's 2,148 MW power  project in Dabhol in Maharashtra. After being forced to renegotiate a power  supply deal in 1995 after concluding it in 1992, Enron has hit the headlines  once again.  This time, an almost bankrupt state electricity board (SEB) refuses to pay  its dues for power received and the state government refuses to honour its  commitment to pay in case the SEB defaults.It's led to intense speculation  that, after suffering repeated snags for nearly a decade, Enron might simply  pull out of the project altogether. A disturbing turn of events, since, till  recently, Enron Corp was the biggest foreign investor in India.  It will not be the first time that exasperation will have egged on a foreign  investor to pull out of a project. Earlier, US-based Cogentrix Energy had  also walked out of its $1.5 billion 1,000 MW Mangalore power project citing  endless bureaucratic hurdles.  And there has also been some disappointment over India's much-hyped 300  million middle class which was supposed to be growing rapidly. Many  international firms, inspired by this figure, had scrambled to set up  operations to conquer a huge chunk of this market. Now many are struggling to  break even and still learning to adapt to local tastes a key ingredient for  success. That's why despite all its attempts to open up various sectors,  India still remains a tough sell.  Outlook  With a little help from the rains, India could notch up a growth rate of six  per cent. Many economists have also pointed out that a reforms-studded budget  could also inject some enthusiasm in the patient that is the economy. Strong  measures include plans to reform labour laws and government employment. These  are expected to boost the economy's development, though in the long run.  The recent opening up of various sectors could also revive sentiment,  although whether this will translate into FDI flows is arguable. Still, every  bit helps. The fact remains that it will have to persist in trying to  accelerate the pace of growth if its ambitions of turning into an economic  powerhouse are to be realised. After all, for the second most populous nation  in the world with one of the biggest markets, its economic power is still  nowhere near the figure its size suggests.

All Rights Reserved  Sometimes even Cabinet officers can lose their way in the White House. So  there was Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson, clearly lost  Friday at a fork in a corridor near White House spokesman Ari Fleischer's  office.  "How do you get to the Oval Office?" he asked a group of reporters and was  directed to the right door, according to a wire report. Fleischer, though, told reporters that was the wrong answer.  "How do you get to the Oval Office? First you win the Iowa caucus, then you  lose the New Hampshire primary, then you make a comeback in South Carolina,"  he quipped as he recalled President Bush's early primary campaign last year.  Passport, Please  Meanwhile, folks at Thompson's HHS may be taking to calling him "Tightwad  Tommy." Seems a memo went out March 15 undermining Alaska and Hawaii's claims  to be part of the United States.  Employees "must clear . . . international travel" with the office of the  deputy chief of staff for operations, said the memo from the deputy chief, Ed  Sontag. To clarify, "HHS employees seeking to travel outside the continental  U.S." for meetings and conferences, must get permission and then file trip  reports within two weeks.  This sent officials calling around, asking whether trips to those states were  to go through the international travel approval system just as if they were  going to Russia or the Congo.  Apparently so. The edict would appear to include even the nearby Virgin  Islands and practically next-door Puerto Rico as well. Loop Fans can only  hope this outrage doesn't spread to other agencies. It would make for some  cold winters.  Chewing Out on the Bush Beat  Speaking of Fleischer, the usually affable spokesman is not reluctant to get  tough with reporters when he believes they've stepped out of line.  Sheriff Fleischer was on duty Thursday and upset with Houston Chronicle  reporter Bennett Roth. Bush that morning urged parents to talk more to their  kids about the dangers of drugs.  Roth, at Fleischer's daily briefing, asked: "Ari, the president talked about  parental involvement today. How much has he talked to his own daughters about  both drugs and drinking? And given the fact that his own daughter was cited  for underage drinking, isn't that a sign that there's only so much effect  that a parent can have on their children's behavior?"  Fleischer responded brusquely: "No, I think, frankly, there are some issues  where I think it's very important for you all in the press corps to recognize  that he is the president of the United States; he's also a father. And the  press corps has been very respectful in the past of treating family matters  with privacy, and I'm certain that you're going to do so again. I hope so."  Fleischer later called Roth to chastise him, telling him his question had  been "noted in the building."  Competing to Oversee the Corps  Former Mississippi representative Mike Parker, a Democrat-turned-Republican  who lost a gubernatorial bid a couple of years back, had been seen as the  pick to be assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, overseeing the  Army Corps of Engineers.  Parker, a former undertaker, had support from the barge industry, the various  corps constituencies and fellow Mississippian Trent Lott, the majority leader  of the Senate.  But the Pentagon's choice was Lawrence Izzo, recently retired president of  Enron Engineering and Construction Co. who has been in the mix for several  jobs. Izzo, a West Point grad, had 23 years at the Corps before going to  Enron, former home of Army secretary-designate Thomas White.  The majority leader was said to be most unhappy. The latest word is Parker's  getting the job.  Ex-Reporters Move On  Kenneth J. Klein, a former reporter who has worked for 17 years for Florida  Sen.

Largest LNG 13 Conference Opens Today  05/14/2001 Korea Times Copyright (C) 2001 Korea Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)  The largest-ever International Conference and Exhibition on liquefied natural  gas (LNG 13) opens today for a four-day run at the Convention and Exhibition  Center (COEX) in southern Seoul.  A total of 125 companies and organizations represented by 2,500 delegates and  exhibitors from 50-odd countries, including Japan, the United States, Britain  and Australia, are participating in the international event, co- organized by  the Korea Gas Union and the Korea Gas Corp. (KOGAS). Commerce, Industry and Energy Minister Chang Che-shik will be delivering  congratulatory remarks on behalf of Prime Minister Lee Han-dong who is  currently on an official trip to the Middle East. There will be a visual  presentation from Lee during the opening ceremony.  ``We have spent more than a year preparing for this international event which  is the largest in terms of the number of participants and exhibitors,'' said  Lee Seung-hwan, chairman of the Korean National Organizing Committee.  LNG 13 is 15 percent larger than the conference and exhibition held in  Australia back in 1998 which reflects the growth of the industry, Lee  explained, adding that the demand for LNG has been increasing rapidly here in  Korea.  A wide range of topics will be presented during the four days of conferences  and exhibitions, helping to showcase the importance of the LNG industry.  Among the numerous papers to be presented at the triennial event are ``Old  World, New World, Tomorrow's World: How LNG Has Changed Since LNG 12'' and  ``The Next Generation of LNG Plants.''  ``Hosting this meaningful event in Korea will help elevate Korea's image in  the international market, particularly with the sheer scale and size of LNG  13,'' said Kim Myung-kyu, president and CEO of KOGAS and chairman of the  Korea gas Union.  The conference will include paper sessions, workshops, poster sessions and  film presentations while exhibitors will demonstrate their exclusive  technologies for the exploration and production of LNG as well as plant  construction.  The official sponsors of LNG 13 are the International Gas Union, the Gas  Technology Institute and the International institute of Refrigeration while  the major sponsors are Shell Gas and Power, KOGAS, LG-Caltex, SK-Enron, the  Qatari Group, TotalFinaElf, British Petroleum and Exxon Mobile.  In addition to the conference and exhibition, there will be a technical visit  to the Inchon LNG Receiving Terminal in Inchon, about 50 kilometers west of  Seoul, on Friday.

Reuters English News Service, 10/11/01     UK: UK Coalpower keen for 500MW station at Hatfield.  10/12/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.  LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Coalpower, the company set up by former RJB Mining chief Richard Budge, says it would like to build a coal-fired power station near its newly acquired Hatfield colliery in South Yorkshire, northern England.  "We are keen to build a 500 megawatt clean coal power plant and are talking to various people", Budge told Reuters on Thursday, adding the chances of such a station coming to fruition would be closely linked to the outcome of Britain's current review of its energy needs to 2050. "Let's see what comes out of the energy review - if it's positive for coal gasification it will not just be our plant that will be built, others will be."  Coalpower acquired the Hatfield coal mine on Monday, beating off competition from U.S. energy group Enron and UK Coal (formerly RJB Mining) and is spending about five million pounds ($8.4 million) to restart production.  Budge said Hatfield has the potential to become a long-life pit with its 100 million tonnes of contiguous coal reserves and he is looking for output in excess of 500,000 tonnes a year.  "Hatfield is the optimum site for a coal gasification combined cycle plant", said Budge, adding Britain needed coal generation to maintain a balanced and diverse energy portfolio.  The government has said it is concerned about Britain's projected dependence on imported natural gas.  Conventional coal burning power stations are high in fossil fuel emissions, which many scientists believe contribute to global warming. But gasification combined cycle technology converts coal to a gaseous fuel from which most of the impurities are removed prior to combustion.  Supporters of coal say the clean coal technology can address many of the environmental concerns of burning coal.  Coal mining in Britain has been in decline for decades, but the fuel still accounts for about a third of its power generation and recent signs point to the industry enjoying a mini revival.  A doubling in the price of British natural gas over the last year has led to a rise in coal demand as electricity generators seek out the cheapest fuel in a highly competitive market. The increased demand for coal has propelled prices to about 35 pounds a tonne compared with 22.50 #18 months ago.  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

(AP) - Enron will not be a partner in a proposed natural gas power plant here, the project's managing director said Thursday.  But Gary Marcus, who owns Coburg Power, said losing the Texas-based conglomerate will not stop the project. "Enron never drove this deal," he said. "I invited Enron into the deal."  Marcus said Enron's participation improved the quality of the plant's design but slowed the decision-making process. Marcus predicted he will find a new backer in less than six months and will have a license to build the project within a year.  Enron backed out because the project did not meet its market strategy, Marcus said.  Enron officials couldn't be reached for comment.  Enron's departure will do little to appease local residents, who fear that the power plant will harm ground water and air quality.  "I don't think it'll ever be built," said Kent Johnston of Coburg, a project opponent. "If the people of Coburg and Eugene have anything to say about it, it won't be."  Added Joey Gayles, a committee chairman in the residents' opposition group, "We're going to fight (Marcus) tooth and nail."  The proposed 40-acre site north of Coburg meets all criteria for construction of a 300-megawatt plant on 12 acres of the site, Marcus said. The remainder of the site would be used for buffer area and wetlands mitigation.  An additional eight acres will be required for the 600-megawatt plant that Coburg Power wants to build, he said. The larger plant would require additional permits that might delay the project.  Expanding the existing natural gas pipeline that runs under the site also would add to the plant's cost. The larger plant would generate the equivalent of all power currently consumed in Lane County.  Marcus estimated the cost of the larger plant at $300 million to $400 million. The smaller plant would cost about $180 million, he said.  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	  UK Crt Blocks Challenge To Intl Arbitration In Enron Spat  10/12/2001 Dow Jones International News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  BOMBAY (AP)--A Commercial Court in London has restrained an Indian state government from blocking international arbitration proceedings by the U.S. power giant Enron to recover claims of up to $5 billion, a company statement said Friday.  "The injunction facilitates a timely and impartial review by the international arbitration panel of the dispute between the Dabhol Power Company and the Maharashtra state government," said the statement issued in Bombay, India's financial capital. Wednesday's court injunction in London is expected to block the state government's move to settle the dispute in India through the state-owned Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission.  Enron said the original contract for the disputed Dabhol power project required international arbitration. The company accused the state government of using a delaying tactic by trying to halt the international arbitration in favor of a settlement procedure in India.  Enron has a 65% stake in the Dabhol Power Co. Its 2,184-megawatt power project is India's biggest foreign investment. In phase one of the project, Enron supplied electricity from naphtha for its sole customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, which has said it can't afford the prices negotiated seven years ago.  The contract included a federal government guarantee to cover any nonpayment. Enron has said guarantee hasn't been met, despite two notices to the federal government.  The second part of the project, more than 90% complete, involves building a new plant to produce electricity from liquefied natural gas, and a container ship port to import it.  Houston-based Enron says it has halted construction for the second phase and it was costing hundreds of millions of dollars.

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- The Commercial Court of London has restrained India's Maharashtra state government from filing a suit in India challenging the international arbitration proceedings initiated by Dabhol Power Co., reports the Hindu Business Line.  Dabhol Power is an Indian unit of U.S.-based energy company Enron Corp. (ENE). The newspaper says Dabhol obtained the court order Thursday, and the state government has 23 days to respond.  Dabhol is locked in a long-standing payment dispute with its sole buyer, Maharashtra State Electricity Board.  Dabhol is a 2,184-megawatt power project located in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. Enron holds a controlling 65% stake in Dabhol. Costing $2.9 billion, the project is the single largest foreign investment in India to date.

Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd. All Rights Res'd  NEW DELHI, Oct. 11 ENRON is looking at a price of about $30 million for exiting from Greenfield Shipping Company, in which one of its affiliates, Atlantic Commercial Inc, is a 20 per cent equity partner.  While Enron's 20 per cent stake in the $220-million LNG venture for Dabhol Power Company comes to $11 million, the Houston-based company is understood to have put up a price of $30 million for exiting from Greenfield, bankers familiar with the developments told Business Line. The $30 million price pegged by Enron for its 20 per cent stake comprises $11 million for equity and $19 million for swapping the company's share of the loan liabilities, the sources said.  Though Atlantic Commercial Inc is yet to make an official statement on pulling out of the LNG shipping deal, it is understood to have conveyed to the project lenders led by ANZ Investment Bank that such a decision was imminent in view of Enron's plan to exit from Dabhol Power Company.  The State-run Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) is a 20 per cent partner in Greenfield, while the remaining 60 per cent equity in the joint venture consortium is held by Japan's Mitsui O.S.K.Lines.  In view of the controversy surrounding the power plant, the lenders to the LNG shipping deal have declared an event of default and suspended the last tranche of the project loan worth $55 million. The ANZ Investment Bank-led consortium has already pumped in $110 million out of a total loan commitment of $165 million for the 137,000 cubic metre capacity tanker being build at Mitsubishi's yard in Japan.  The three promoters will now have to put in additional investments to the tune of $55 million to take possession of the vessel on the scheduled delivery date of November 15.  The board of SCI has not been able to come to a conclusion on putting in extra funds in the project despite discussing the issue several times. A board meet held on Tuesday to discuss the issue again ended in stalemate, Government sources said.  SCI's dilemma on making extra investments in the project also centre around the fate of Enron's equity in the deal. In the event of Enron pulling out of the LNG shipping project, its 20 per cent equity would have to be taken over by the two remaining partners. Besides, these two partners would also have to pool-in the additional investments of $55 million amongst themselves in proportion to their revised equity holdings.  "However, there is a great question mark over whether Mitsui and SCI should agree to take over the equity of Enron", the sources said.  During discussions held in London recently, Mitsui had clearly told the lenders that it was not in favour of putting in extra funds to salvage the LNG shipping deal.  Moreover, with the consortium now looking at a charter hire rate of $60,000 to $65,000 per day as against the rate of $98,600 per day agreed with Dabhol Power Company, both SCI and Mitsui feels that the revised charter hire rates would render their investments unviable.  According to estimates, at a charter hire rate of $60,000 per day, Greenfield is expected to earn about $22 million per annum. Out of this, $4-$5 million will be spent on operating expenses of the tanker.  The remaining $17-18 million will fetch an internal rate of return (IRR) of 7-8 per cent for Mitsui at an equity stake of 60 per cent.  "Mitsui feels that an IRR of this level was not sufficient for their investments", the sources said.  Whereas, for SCI, the investments would fetch a return of 4-4.5 per cent. "This will be far below the Government norm of 12 per cent IRR for projects involving State-funding," the sources said.  P. Manoj  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

All Rights Res'd  MUMBAI, Oct. 11 THE Commercial Court of London has given an ex parte order restraining the Maharashtra Government from filing a suit in India challenging the international arbitration proceedings initiated by Dabhol Power Company (DPC).  The Enron-promoted DPC obtained the order today and the State has 23 days to respond. Maharashtra has been restrained from "commencing or prosecuting or continuing or taking any steps in or otherwise participating in proceedings in any court or tribunal in India in restraint of or otherwise relating to the three arbitrations", the order said. The three arbitrations relate to State guarantees to the project. A DPC spokesman said now "the arbitration process in London would continue as originally contemplated and agreed by the State Government and DPC. This has no bearing on the on-going proceedings involving DPC, MSEB and MERC before the Mumbai High Court and Supreme Court".  He also said Maharashtra is not a party to any of the on-going proceedings before the Mumbai High Court and the Supreme Court. "Over the past few months, the State Government and other Government entities have taken actions to avoid complying with their contractual obligations.  This has frustrated the rights of international investors that were legally agreed to by the relevant parties several years ago. The injunction facilitates the timely and impartial review by the international arbitration panel of the dispute between DPC and the State," the company said.  The arbitration panel had been constituted sometime ago and proceedings were expected to begin any time.  However, the proceedings could not take off as a dispute over the jurisdiction of the Maharashtra State Electricity Regulatory Commission had dragged on to the Mumbai High Court and then the Supreme Court.  Both courts had restrained DPC from continuing international arbitration pending resolution of the MERC jurisdiction issue. The State Government was expected to file a civil suit in the Mumbai High Court accusing the company of fraud and misrepresentation. Internal differences in the Government and the legal team over proving "fraud" had led to the resignation of the State counsel.  Our Bureau  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 11 (Reuters) - A Sempra Energy unit said on Thursday its new system for running fiber-optic cable through natural gas pipelines, in turn leaving city streets intact, could begin commercial service in December.  Putting fiber-optic lines in existing natural gas pipelines - which already have cleared rights-of-way - could tackle the telecommunications industry's "last mile" problem of connecting end users to outlying fiber-optic cable networks without tearing up roadways. A surge in demand for high-speed Internet access has led telecommunications companies to pour billions of dollars into vast nationwide fiber-optic systems that carry data to computers, phones and screens faster than traditional copper wires.  Sempra Fiber Links, a unit of San Diego-based Sempra Energy, made the announcement after its first installation of the technology in the gas distribution system of Frontier Energy, a Sempra Energy unit in North Carolina.  Sempra's technology involves encasing fiber-optic cable in a protective polyethylene conduit before inserting it through the same local gas lines serving utility customers.  The company said installing the cable would not prevent a utility from servicing its gas lines or keeping them safe.  Jennifer Andrews, a Sempra Fiber Links spokeswoman, said the company was discussing its fiber-in-gas system with gas utilities throughout the United States.  SAVINGS  Andrews said companies using the technology could save from 30 percent to 50 percent on last mile costs compared with traditional trenching and installation methods.  Sempra Energy unit Southern California Gas Co., one of the largest gas utilities in the U.S. with about 18 million customers, plans to use fiber-in-gas technology in its system as soon as it is approved by the California Public Utilities Commission.  Energy companies that have ventured into the fiber-optic business by building infrastructure and/or through bandwidth trade, include Williams Cos ., El Paso Corp. ., Enron Corp. , Dynegy Inc. , Duke Energy , Consolidated Edison Inc. and Montana Power Co. .  In March 2000, Montana Power announced plans to divest its energy business and invest the proceeds into its broadband and telecommunications unit Touch America.

The Wall Street Journal Online  Stocks rallied sharply Monday despite the widening anthrax scare, as a batch of better-than-expected quarterly earnings reports cheered investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 172.92, or 1.9%, to close at 9377.03 after gaining 40.89 points Friday. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 36.75, or 2.2%, to 1708.06 after climbing 18.59 points in the previous session.  Other major stock indexes gained ground Monday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 16.42 to 1089.90, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 7.13 to 561.45, and the Russell 2000 Index gained 4.80 to 430.50.  Bonds were mixed and the dollar strengthened.  The stock market's gains were tempered briefly by news that a postal worker in Washington, D.C., was diagnosed with anthrax contracted by inhalation. Additionally, two other postal workers in Washington have died and their deaths are being investigated to determine if they died of that same ailment.  But stocks took the anthrax reports in stride, suggesting a new and surprising level of confidence among market participants, some analysts said Monday. "The market is really shrugging off this news," said Mark Donahoe, a managing director at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.  Upbeat earnings news from American Express, released Monday afternoon, seemed to give stocks an additional lift.  Investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and U.S. military maneuvers in Afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results, said Steven Kroll Sr., managing director at Monness, Crepsi & Hardt.  The uncertainty on the global front "looks like it is going to be a long, drawn-out affair," Mr. Kroll said. "I think stocks will revert back to being earnings-driven."  Although dismal by ordinary standards, last week's flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors, who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations. "The markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings," said Mr. Donahoe of U.S. Bancorp. That resilience might be giving hope to investors this week, he added.  Still, investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up, Mr. Kroll argued.  Third-quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on Monday, with big companies such as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing and U.S. Steel posting results that met or topped analysts' estimates.  The Dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p.m. EDT when index component American Express reported earnings that, excluding certain items, beat Wall Street previously lowered estimates.  The financial-services concern posted net income of $298 million, or 22 cents a share, down 60% from $737 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the September 11 attacks, American Express said it would have earned $595 million, or 45 cents a share, for the latest quarter. Analysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.  Shares of American Express surged after the quarterly earnings release, closing up 3.4% at $30.32.  Chip stocks helped lead the Nasdaq composite higher, with the Philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5.4%. The rally seemed to be a continuation of Friday's gains in the sector, sparked by positive earnings news from KLA-Tencor.  U.S. Steel, the nation's No. 1 steelmaker, said it swung to a third-quarter loss from a profit a year earlier, hurt by oversupply and a weak economy. But excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another, U.S. Steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. Shares of U.S. Steel rose 9.7% to $14.74.  Investors also sent 3M shares nearly 5% higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by Wall Street estimates, despite a 21% decline in net income. And oil producers Conoco and USX-Marathon Group handily beat analysts' forecasts.  But not all the earnings news was cheery. Local phone company SBC Communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates. Shares of SBC, a component of the Dow industrials, fell 5.1% to $41.40.  Meanwhile, the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging, some analysts noted. On Monday, 3M guided Wall Stret's earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter, and a top executive at U.S. Steel told analysts that the company's fourth quarter would be "difficult."  Companies "are meeting third quarter expectations, but they are talking down the fourth quarter," said Mr. Kroll of Monness Crespi & Hardt. He said that some of the rise in Monday's markets might be a carryover from Friday's buying activity related to the expiration of U.S. stock option and index option contracts, an event known as "double witching."  One of the hardest-hit stocks on Monday was Enron, an energy concern that said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was seeking information about certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer. Shares of Enron plunged 21% to $20.65.  Overseas, stocks closed higher. London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index gained 1.1%, while Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index rose 2%. Earlier in the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.3%, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended 0.3% lower.  In economic news, the Conference Board reported that its index of leading indicators for the month fell 0.5% in September, matching the estimates of economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets. The index -- a composite of measurements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy -- included some data gathered after the Sept. 11 attacks.  The decline, which was the index's largest one-month drop since January 1996, confirmed that the widespread weakness in the U.S. economy is deepening, the Conference Board said. Falling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the September reading.  In August, the leading-indicators index slipped 0.1%, less than the previous estimate of a 0.3% decline. Even so, the back-to-back declines paint a bleak economic picture, said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein.  The two-month decline in the index suggests that the already-weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year, Mr. Goldstein said. The overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown.  In major U.S. market action:  Stocks rose.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A shareholder of Enron Corp. (ENE) filed a derivative suit in Texas court alleging that Enron's board breached their fiduciary duties to the company by allowing Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships.  In a press release Monday, a law firm representing the unnamed shareholder said that Enron's board lost over $35 million by allowing Fastow to run these partnerships, which engaged in transactions with Enron and presented a conflict of interest. The suit alleges that the limited partnerships bought Enron assets, permitting Fastow to use his inside knowledge of the company's financial condition to earn millions of dollars.  On Oct. 16, Enron announced that it will take a $35 million charge relating to the limited partnerships and revealed that the company had to repurchase 55 million of its shares in order to unwind its involvement in the partnerships, thereby reducing the company's shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.  On Monday, Enron said the Securities and Exchange Commission recently requested additional information regarding the limited partnerships.  On Oct. 19, The Wall Street Journal reported that Fastow, and possibly a handful of partnership associates, realized more than $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital increases on an investment of nearly $3 million in the partnership, which was set up in Dec. 1999 principally to do business with Enron.  Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been with the firm 11 years, which included extensive work setting up and managing company investments.  Enron's New York Stock Exchange listed shares fell to a 52-week low on Monday following news that the SEC requested additional information.  A spokeswoman from Enron said the company has not seen the lawsuit and it does not comment on pending litigation.  -Thomas Gryta; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5400    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Shapiro Haber & Urmy Files Class Action on Behalf of Purchasers of Enron Corporation Stock (NYSE: ENE) in The Period From July 13, 2001 Through October 16, 2001  10/22/2001 PR Newswire (Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire) BOSTON, Oct. 22 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Shapiro Haber & Urmy LLP has filed a class action suit alleging securities fraud in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division), 515 Rusk Ave., Houston, Texas 77002, against Enron Corporation ("Enron") (NYSE: ENE) and certain of its officers and directors.  The case was filed on behalf of all purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period from July 13, 2001 through October 16, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period"). The complaint alleges that the defendants violated section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("the Exchange Act"), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and that defendants' wrongful conduct artificially inflated the price of Enron common stock during the Class Period. The complaint charges that the defendants misrepresented and concealed material facts concerning the Company's financial transactions with two partnerships established by Enron's Chief Financial Officer, which resulted in substantial losses to Enron and a reduction in shareholders' equity of over $1 billion. The price of Enron's common stock plummeted over 20% in just three trading days following disclosure of the financial losses resulting from Enron's dealings with these partnerships.  Plaintiff seeks to recover damages suffered by class members and is represented by the law firm of Shapiro Haber & Urmy LLP, which has successfully prosecuted numerous securities class actions on behalf of defrauded investors.

NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Shares of Enron Corp. slumped more than 20 percent on Monday after it said U.S. regulators are looking into company transactions, another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in August.  A spokesman for North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, but said it was cooperating. The SEC also declined to outline details of its inquiry. Investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from The Wall Street Journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. The company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years, and took $1.01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments.  Problems at Enron surfaced two months ago when CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after only six months at the helm.  Enron shares declined $5.49, or 21 percent, to $20.56 in Monday afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange, shaving off almost $4.2 billion of its market capitalization. The stock, the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the NYSE, fell as much as 22.8 percent on Monday, when it opened at its lowest level since September 1998.  Shares declined 23 percent last week after the Journal ran its first story about the limited partnerships on Wednesday.  Enron declined to comment on whether the SEC's inquiry into "certain related party transactions" involved the partnerships.  "Related party transactions" is the heading used by Enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and the larger LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  Fastow severed his ties to the partnerships in June. LJM was set up in June 1999 for energy-related investments, and LJM2 in December 1999 for energy-and communication-related investments.  The Journal reported $35 million of its third-quarter loss of $638 million were connected with the limited partnerships  Curt Launer, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said investors should question Enron's use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets, "most notably in telecommunications," have declined precipitously.  "Investors have had several opportunities to question Enron's credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined," Launer said.  Some analysts, though, cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke.  "This is an inquiry, not an investigation, and I cannot imagine Enron's attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal," said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey.  "It's easy for the market to kick a company when its down, but these challenges do not last for a solid company, and we think Enron is one."  Shares in the company are down 75 percent this year.

The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. HOUSTON (AP) - Shares of Enron Corp. plunged more than 20 percent Monday after the energy trading giant said the Securities and Exchange Commission had sought information company's transactions with limited partnerships, which were managed by an Enron senior officer.  In a statement, Enron said it had provided the regulatory agency with information in response to an inquiry last week. "We welcome this request," Enron chairman and chief executive officer Kenneth L. Lay said in a statement Monday. "We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest."  Investors were upset by the news, however, sending shares of Enron down dlrs 5.30 to dlrs 20.75 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  The transactions took place in 1999 and 2000, according to Houston-based Enron's 2000 annual report. They resulted in a dlrs 16 million pre-tax gain to Enron in 1999 and a dlrs 36 million loss in 2000.  Enron officials declined to provide details about the transactions or name the limited partnerships, instead referring questions to a section of the annual report on related party transactions.  "Enron entered into transactions with (limited partnerships) to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets," according to the section in the annual report.  Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the SEC first contacted Enron last week and described the request is an "informal inquiry."  "This is not an investigation," he said. "We see the request as an opportunity to put this issue behind us."  SEC spokesman John Heine said he could not comment on the filings. "We can't confirm or deny that type of activity," Heine said.  The electricity marketer and natural gas provider says both internal and external auditors and attorneys reviewed the related party arrangements, the company's board was fully informed of and approved the arrangements, and they were disclosed in the company's SEC filings.

STOCKWATCH Enron lower after SEC questions transactions; AG Edwards downgrades  10/22/2001 AFX News (c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were down sharply in late morning trade, after the Securities and Exchange Commission requested the company to provide information on certain related-party transactions, prompting AG Edwards to downgrade the stock to 'hold' from 'buy', dealers said.  At 11.10 am, Enron was down 4.29 usd, or 16.47 pct, at 21.76. The DJIA was up 57.57 points at 9,261.68, and the S&P 500 composite index was up 5.57 points at 1,079.05. In a statement this morning, Enron confirmed that the SEC had requested documents, and said it would "cooperate fully" with the commission.  However, the company did not give any details of the transactions concerned or of the reasons behind the SEC's request.  According to AG Edwards analyst Mike Heim, Enron "significantly reduced" its equity to unroll a partnership arrangement with a partially-owned subsidiary formerly run by Enron's chief financial officer.  "This arrangement, which was not discussed in past SEC filings, has led to a growing distrust of the company by the financial community.  "In our opinion, the market is most likely overreacting to the news being disseminated over the last few days.  "However, we can give no assurances that all the problems at Enron have been fully disclosed," Heim said.  In its statement this morning, Enron said although its internal and external auditors and attorneys have reviewed the related-party arrangements, adding that the Board was "fully informed of and approved these arrangements", which were disclosed in the company's SEC filings.  "We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done," said chief executive Kenneth Lay.  ng/gc For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron Shares Slide as SEC Seeks Information on Deals With CFO's Partnership  10/22/2001 Dow Jones Business News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) HOUSTON -- Shares of Enron Corp. slumped Monday after the energy-trading concern said the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for information about "certain related party transactions," including those between Enron and a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer.  Enron promised to cooperate fully with the SEC request and said in a prepared statement that it "welcomes" the request and looks forward to put "any concern about these transactions to rest." In 4 p.m. EDT trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron (ENE) shares fell $5.40, or 21%, to $20.65.  Last week The Wall Street Journal reported that a limited partnership organized by Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, made millions in profits in transactions with the firm. The story cited information reported in an internal partnership document.  Enron also said last week it will repurchase up to 55 million shares that it had issued as part of transactions with LJM2 CO-Investment LP, the limited partnership created by Mr. Fastow.  In addition, Enron took a $1.01 billion charge in the third quarter, mostly connected with write-downs of bad investments, producing a loss of $618 million, or 84 cents a share. Excluding charges, income was $393 million, or 43 cents a share, in the quarter.  The charge covers a wide range of items including costs related to the limited partnerships that were, until recently, by Mr. Fastow.  The company said the costs connected with the partnerships total $35 million and involve the early termination of "certain structured finance arrangements."  The partnerships were set up two years ago, and while the company maintains that they are perfectly proper, some have suggested that it is a conflict of interest for Enron's chief financial officer to be involved in a partnership that was looking to purchase Enron assets, the Journal reported.  The energy company said its auditors reviewed the arrangements and its board was fully informed and approved the deals, which were disclosed in SEC filings.  "We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done," Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said on Monday.  Separately, an Enron shareholder filed a derivative lawsuit in Texas court alleging Enron's board breached its fiduciary duties to the company by allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships.  A law firm representing the unnamed shareholder said in a prepared statement that Enron's board lost over $35 million by allowing Mr. Fastow to run these partnerships, which engaged in transactions with Enron and presented a conflict of interest.  The suit alleges that the limited partnerships bought Enron assets, permitting Mr. Fastow to use his inside knowledge of the company's financial condition to earn millions of dollars.  -- Bill Platt of Dow Jones Newswires contributed to this report.

Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update8) 2001-10-22 17:10 (New York)  Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update8)       (Adds in sixth paragraph that analyst estimates dissolving affiliated companies would cost $3 billion.)       Houston, Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares fell 21 percent after the Houston-based company said the Securities and Exchange Commission requested information on partnerships run by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives.       Enron, the largest energy trader, created partnerships and other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets such as power plants to lower the debt on its books. An investor sued Enron's board Wednesday, saying two partnerships cost the company $35 million and Fastow's leadership of them was a conflict of interest.       Investors today said they were concerned that Enron may be forced to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the owners in cash or stock. Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he may be have to ``unravel'' agreements that created the companies if Enron's debt ratings fall too far.       ``We need confidence their long-term credit rating won't go below investment grade,'' said Roger Hamilton, an analyst at John Hancock's value funds, which own 600,000 Enron shares.        Enron reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion when it repurchased 55 million shares of two such partnerships controlled by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LMJ2 Co-Investment, the Wall Journal reported last week.       Dismantling more of the affiliated companies and partnerships would cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, Ray Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to investors today.       Enron shares fell $5.40 to $20.65. They touched $19.67 during the day's trading, the lowest level since Jan. 15, 1998.                             Shares Plunge       The stock has fallen 75 percent this year amid concerns about failed investments in trading of space on fiber-optic communications networks and a water company, and the resignation of Jeff Skilling as CEO in August after seven months on the job.       While Skilling said he resigned for personal reasons, investors say his departure led them to question whether the company was concealing problems, including possible liabilities from affiliated companies.       On Tuesday, Enron surprised many investors when it reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, the result of writing off $1.01 billion in failed investments.        Moody's Investors Service placed the company's debt on watch for possible downgrade. The company's debt is rated at investment grade by Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's.       The company received a faxed request for information from the SEC on Wednesday asking for information, spokesman Mark Palmer said, and will respond ``as soon as possible.''       ``We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest,'' Lay, who is also Enron's chairman, said in a statement.                            Dilution Fears       Enron has formed at least 18 companies to serve as financing vehicles for its projects, based on filings with the Texas secretary of state. Fastow and other Enron executives are named as the controlling partners or the board members in the companies.       Some have bought Enron assets such as power plants, removing the debt for those projects from Enron's books. That allows Enron to keep cash earned from the main trading business from supporting what it views as secondary businesses, Standard & Poor's debt analyst Todd Shipman said.        Enron brokers trades of electricity, natural gas and other commodities as well as owns power plants and natural-gas pipelines.       Dismantling the affiliates would be costly. Whitewing Management, an affiliated company that has bought 14 Enron power plants and lists Fastow as managing director, holds 250,000 preferred shares of Enron.       Enron may have to convert the preferred shares to common stock if share prices fall below a certain level and the credit rating drops below investment grade, according to company filings. That would dilute the value of common shareholders' investment.       ``The concern is how many of these dilutive structures are out there?'' Shipman said. ``Investors are worried they might have to share their Enron earnings with a lot more people than they originally thought.''                          Worrisome Financing       Enron's auditors and attorneys reviewed the company's ``related party arrangements,'' the board approved them, and they were disclosed in SEC filings, Enron said in its statement.       That hasn't eased concerns. The reduction of shareholder equity by $1.2 billion from the LJM partnerships is reason to worry about Enron's other financing vehicles, wrote Niles, the Salomon analyst. Enron also may take another $2.4 billion in losses from investments in the Dabhol power plant in India and projects in South America, he wrote.       Enron's 8 percent coupon bonds due in 2005 fell $34 per $1,000 face value to be offered at $1,022 today from $1,056 on Friday, traders said. Yield on the debt rose to 7.33 percent from 6.33 percent.       Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long- term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above investment grade.       Fastow continues to work, and Enron hasn't punished him, Palmer said. Fastow declined to be interviewed, spokeswoman Karen Denne said. SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on the agency's request to Enron.       ``We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done,'' Lay said in the statement.

Chairman Kenneth Lay tried to convince analysts and investors that the company has no more surprises.       With the analysts, he apparently succeeded. Enron remains one of Wall Street's most highly rated stocks, even after the largest energy trader acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run by its chief financial officer led to a writedown of $1.2 billion in shareholder equity.       Lay wasn't so successful with investors, who have abandoned Enron shares, slashing their value 42 percent in a week.       ``You've got a lot of people lining up to say the emperor has no clothes,'' said Richard Gross of Lehman Brothers Inc., who today repeated his ``strong buy'' rating on Enron. Analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and other firms have also kept their highest ratings on Enron.       Gross still likes the look of Enron's finery. ``The core franchise here is very valuable,'' he said, and the stock's decline more than reflects the ``worst case'' for the company.       In Boston and at similar meetings in Houston and New York, Lay had to explain the unwinding of the partnerships. He and other Enron executives assured investors the company has no more surprises in store, according to Greg Phelps, who manages $1.1 billion at John Hancock Advisers Inc., and attended the Boston session.       The partnerships functioned somewhat like private equity funds, according to analysts and investors, and included investments that lost money. The Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for more information about them, Enron said yesterday.                          One Hold, One Sell       While two analysts have cut their Enron ratings after learning about the partnerships, they only dented the company's popularity on Wall Street.       Michael Heim of A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis lowered his rating to ``hold'' from ``buy'' on Friday. He said he has been looking for discussion of the partnerships in Enron's SEC filings and is only seeing ``vague references'' that don't leave him with a ``good comfort level.''       With Heim's rating change, Enron went from being the second most highly rated stock in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index to the 10th, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.       Today, Zach Wagner at Edward Jones & Co. in St. Louis cut Enron to ``reduce'' from ``accumulate.'' Ratings by Edward Jones, which caters to individual investors rather than institutions, aren't tracked by First Call.       First Call translates analyst ratings into numbers, with ``strong buy'' a one, ``buy'' a two, and so on, then averages the ratings to rank a company's Wall Street popularity. The most highly rated stock is Tyco International Ltd., which has fallen 12 percent this year.       Enron shares fell 86 cents to $19.79 today.                          Remaining Skeptical       However highly brokerage analysts rate the stock, ``I have to remain skeptical,'' said Barry Borak, energy analyst at David L. Babson & Co., which manages $60 billion in Cambridge, Massachusetts.       ``There's been a huge loss of management credibility at Enron,'' Borak said, because of the partnerships and the unexpected departure in August of Jeffrey Skilling, who had held the post of chief executive officer for six months and was heir apparent to Lay. ``Nobody I've talked to thinks (Skilling's departure) is for personal reasons,'' Borak said.       Skilling helped transform Enron from a gas pipeline company into the biggest energy trading company. Enron also owns power plants in deregulated markets.       Borak said Babson doesn't own Enron shares and won't be a buyer ``until I can get better, more thorough information about what else might pop up in the future.''       Borak and other investors said Enron has a reputation for not providing enough information about its businesses, and they said this makes the positive view of the company on Wall Street more difficult to understand.       After Skilling resigned, Lay said the company would be more open about its businesses. A bullet point in his talk in Boston was ``increased transparency of financial and operating results,'' according to a handout provided at the Boston meeting.                           Amazed, Dismayed       Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale wrote in a note to clients last week that she was ``amazed at the willingness of Enron's management to break out earnings and expenses to the degree that it disclosed in the third quarter.''       Coale also wrote that she was ``dismayed by the apparent `disguise' of the additional $1.2 billion equity hit that was not disclosed in (Enron's) press release and was briefly mentioned in the earnings conference call.'' Coale kept her rating on Enron at ``buy.''       Phelps at John Hancock said that his ``cynical side'' believes that investment banking business has helped keep Wall Street recommending Enron stock. ``They provide some good underwriting business,'' he said.       Credit Suisse First Boston managed a secondary sale of 12 million Enron shares in 1999, with Lehman Brothers acting as co-manager. Credit Suisse has also managed bond sales for Enron this year.    Enron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1) 2001-10-23 16:38 (New York)  Enron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)       (Updates with closing share price in sixth paragraph.)       New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the biggest energy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750 million loan, ensuring access to credit if the company is cut off from money markets, say people familiar with the matter.       Enron's shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating its finances. The company depends on a $3 billion commercial paper, or short-term debt, program to finance day-to-day operations.       Moody's Investors Service last week placed all $13 billion of the company's long-term debt securities on watch for possible downgrade. Any drop in the rating may cut off Enron from the commercial paper market, raising the costs of short-term debt.       ``We understand that our credit rating is critical to both the capital markets and our counterparties,'' Enron's Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow said on a conference call today. He said Enron has $3.5 billion available on bank credit lines, giving it enough cash to operate normally.       Dan Noonan, a spokesman for Citigroup's Citibank NA unit, declined to comment. Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, also wouldn't comment.       Shares of Enron, based in Houston, fell 86 cents to $19.79. They have fallen 76 percent this year.                           Complex Financing       An investor sued Enron last week, saying dealings with two partnerships run by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, cost the company $35 million. The suit also calls Fastow's leadership of the partnerships, set up to remove debt from Enron's books, a conflict of interest.       Enron bought back 62 million shares to unwind positions in some partnerships run by Fastow, said Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay on the conference call with investors today.       The number of shares differs from a Wall Street Journal report on Thursday that said Enron had bought back 55 million shares. The buyback reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion, the Journal said.       The company set up the partnerships and other affiliated companies to buy Enron assets such as power plants. The partnerships allow Enron to take debt off its books, letting it borrow to invest in its main business of commodities trading, Enron said. Enron trades electricity, natural gas, oil, coal and other commodities.       ```They have complex off-balance sheet financing,'' said Commerzbank analyst Andre Mead. ``It's difficult to ascertain the full impact on shareholders.''       The SEC has asked Enron about partnerships and affiliated companies headed by Fastow. The company has at least $3 billion in such ``off-the-books'' financing in affiliated companies, Ray Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to investors.                        Depends on Asset Sales       One partnership, Whitewing Management, owns 250,000 preferred shares that Enron may have to convert to common stock. Whitewing partners can demand their preferred shares be converted if Enron common stock falls below a certain price or if Enron's credit rating drops under investment grade.       Whitewing and other Enron partnerships and trusts include company executives as officers and directors, according to records from the Texas secretary of state.       ``Over the life of these trust structures, Enron has in fact issued a sizable amount of equity,'' Enron Treasurer Ben Gilsan said. Most of that was shares issued to Enron executives as part of a deferred compensation plan, Gilsan said.       The Whitewing partnership was financed with $1.4 billion in bonds sold last year. The partnership used some of the proceeds to buy Enron power plants and plans to retire the debt by selling them, officials said on the conference call. Other company partnerships operate with the same strategy.       ``Some investors are worried the asset sales won't cover the full amount (borrowed), and Enron will have to furnish support to the detriment of shareholders,'' said Commerzbank analyst Meade.                        Commercial Paper Rates       Enron was paying 3.15 percent to issue commercial paper until Oct. 31, which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies with the same ``A2/P2'' short-term credit ratings that are not on credit watch. Enron's short-term debt is not on review for a possible downgrade.       Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long- term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above investment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's rate the company's debt at investment grade.       Enron has previously turned to Citigroup for finance and advice. In 1999, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit advised the company on its $1.45 billion acquisition of three natural gas- fired power plants from Cogen Technologies Inc. Citibank, along with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., this year arranged a $1.75 billion loan.    How Enron Blew It Texas Monthly November 2001  Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon= ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo= st important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be= arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?  by Mimi Swartz <http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.p= hp> =20 THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th= e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=  way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c= ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod= ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b= rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T= hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif= orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu= blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin= g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-= size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva= tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe= ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti= pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi= s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe= inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula= ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e= levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: "From the World's = Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"  For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro= m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000= . It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per= cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil= lion to $100 billion. "The very mention of the company in energy circles th= roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"=  notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma= rket intelligence to the energy business.  This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine= d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b= y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old = formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then = selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co= mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=  to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E= nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor= ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y= ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning = power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was = new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra= ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T= he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo= rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe= eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, "was a great mar= riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me= ntality of the financial markets."  The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en= d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=  was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ= an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a = culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t= he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh= o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=  the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=  company couldn't possibly go wrong.  Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of = $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene= rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=  his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro= ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications= , in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o= nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha= nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer= tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha= t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.  ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD "a totally different way of thinking about b= usiness-we got it." At Enron, in fact, you either "got it" or you were gone= -it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th= e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he = once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga= ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=  off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b= lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar= ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil= ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus= t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene= ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame= rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc= hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, "someone cou= ld actually get killed." Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr= istmas morning. "I had no idea what I'd let go of," Skilling says of all th= e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20  From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=  photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o= f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc= ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash= er. He almost missed his brother's wedding. "Learning a foreign language-I = never learned a foreign language!" he exclaims. He never once took his youn= gest son to school. "I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte= en-minute scheduling." Travel: "You can't go to Africa for a week and get a= nything out of it!" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design = on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. "I'm not sure=  that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job," he says, finally= . Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it= s pragmatic edge. "It would have been easy to stay," he says. "But that wou= ld not have been good for me."=20  He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand= some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi= duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=  underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r= eporters who have labeled his resignation "bizarre" and associates who are = bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim= its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=  upon. "I'm surprised," he says, "that people have so much trouble understa= nding this."  PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni= neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo= lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t= o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist= ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur= ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=  hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho= se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th= at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters = in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=  the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s= uch humiliation?  But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti= es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g= as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque= ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v= olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede= ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl= y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=  from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa= s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc= o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc= toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V= ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar= dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H= NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat= e of Texas.  HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte= mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska = pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i= n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=  in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like = Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled "the purchase" was being call= ed "the merger" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular= ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr= avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru= nning a new company called Enron. "Over time it became clear that Lay had a=  better vision of the future," says one person associated with Enron at tha= t time. "He never fought change. He embraced change."  Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=  debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had = exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole = new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s= tarted.=20  LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha= d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h= ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I= llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) "I l= iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart," he told Busines= sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling = wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he = was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w= hat he would come to call "intellectual capital." He loved being smart, and=  he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth= odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too= k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi= s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-= up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as = a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20  It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless= , and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=  all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr= ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al= one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w= here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=  called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th= e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be = a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the = risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv= estment bank would.  Skilling worked up some numbers and found them "absolutely compelling." The= n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec= utives. He had a one-page presentation. "Almost to a person," Skilling says= , "they thought it was stupid." Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej= ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th= en said, "Let's go."  The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=  cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze= ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho= se divides that seem to define his life: "I believed this whole world would=  be different, a huge breakthrough" is the way Skilling puts it today, and = even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching= , the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's = character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=  joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, "We were in= ." And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr= on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo= r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit= . After that, says Skilling, "we never looked back."  Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha= d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w= ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of = gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin= ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b= est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted = to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b= etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m= ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p= rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi= th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could = have ever imagined.  THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m= ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin= ess. The idea was to build a "knowledge-based business," which demanded a s= kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos= t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o= f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=  industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b= older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make = money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. "Enron was going to=  create a niche for itself or die," one former executive explains. "The peo= ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na= rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market." Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s= martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be= cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he = wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big= gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B= oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be "a= ggressive." You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w= ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20 You could see what he was looking for on "Super Saturdays" at the Houston h= eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee= n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=  day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a= bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called "a sense = of urgency." People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest = candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t= he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing = Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma= ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more = than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof= ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun= g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.) For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a= nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc= turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g= lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com= pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=  with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th= e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr= on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou= ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov= erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra= m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t= en at night. "They were so cutting edge," rhapsodizes someone involved with=  the company health care program at the time. "They really thought about th= e psychology and what it took to keep these people going." Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts= , associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos= e titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a= nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus= es-with no cap. "If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=  make a lot of money," says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un= til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div= ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders = with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus= . And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join= ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of= f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp= ectacular Mexican villa. "Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'= d say," one loyalist says.=20 And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m= erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b= uzzword was "aggressive," that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie= ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=  Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv= ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega= n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa= ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se= rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer= e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo= rts). But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m= ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, = the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar= gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio= n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $= 2 billion to $7 billion. "Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil=  in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track," the New = York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill= ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran= sforming another. "FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"=  sang the New York Times in 1999. "In the staid world of regulated utilitie= s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis," crowed For= tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl= e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million= , up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis= cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste= el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=  client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg= e against the usual winter downturn? But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c= ommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be= came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o= nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi= d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr= on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt= y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi= ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha= t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=  deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=  in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. "Its strat= egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo= dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market," BusinessWeek insis= ted. There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: = the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c= ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust= omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t= o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli= ents as customers and began calling them "counterparties." Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m= aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=  overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur= e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi= l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un= derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark= ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals= , from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene= d at all.=20 While many businesses used what was known in the industry as "mark-to-marke= t accounting," for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c= ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=  idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge= t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an= nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How= ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=  went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig= ht be something fishy about what they called "subjective accounting," inves= tors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark= et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec= t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't = going to be high enough. "Enron is known for leaving people at the altar," = says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp= any could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser=  for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c= ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe= ting literacy charity: "Even the person who was supposed to give money away=  for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron," he says. As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created = took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En= ron family put it, "It became a company full of mercenaries." The change st= arted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most = of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t= he commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove= rhearing orders like "I need a smart person-go buy me one" or "Buy me an in= telligent slave, quick." Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl= e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa= rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to= o disruptive. People couldn't get their work done. And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension= . The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S= killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s= ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t= hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu= ickly became "rank and yank.") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi= sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc= iate put it, "Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=  store." Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro= n's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att= itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur= e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr= on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=  he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m= ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere. Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: = "They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s= ight of the future," says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de= als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u= ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte= n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase "No old tapes" became a= n Enron clich?. "People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight," says=  one former Enron executive. In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr= ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=  E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on= e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, = but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi= s way: "They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y= ou bleed to death." BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy = company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J= ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i= ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea= lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d= ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr= on's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr= ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm= ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. "It wasn't the tim= e for long-term approaches," an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=  "It was the technology era." To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe= cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye= ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n= ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th= e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En= ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed = $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o= f Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on= e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including = two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo= rate America. But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi= a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w= ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p= ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c= hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth= er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals= , and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew. Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio= ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin= g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen= tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin= g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=  deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d= ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a= s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=  visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa= ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar= k her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, = Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti= lity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri= vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate= st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth= er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20 But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a = business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li= ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=  it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an= d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started = out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=  diminished, was folded into Enron. "I think it's best for Rebecca to start=  afresh," Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=  Or as one critic put it, "They were more interested in destroying the old = culture than running a business."=20 As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay=  announced the inevitable: "The best time for the succession to occur is wh= en the company is doing well," he told the press. "Enron is doing extremely=  well now." In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-= power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac= le. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t= he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L= ay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg= e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo= od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent = anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=  the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif= ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t= ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d= eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=  was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we= aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=  January. Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The = India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of = constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa= tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th= at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population = and never properly managed those it had. "For three months Gray Davis did a=  very good job of blaming us," says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo= rate communications. "We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi= te House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big= gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c= are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis." (Californi= a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=  be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al= l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo= ke comparing California with the Titanic. ("At least the Titanic went down = with its lights on.") But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had = been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors=  believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=  it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for=  buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi= on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d= id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim= e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma= rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=  Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street. Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t= he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D= uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal= lenged Enron's financial reporting an "asshole." When the company reported = hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit= s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse= ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr= omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. "Th= ere wasn't any positive news," Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n= ow. "Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade." The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske= d in March whether Enron was overpriced. ("Start with a pretty straightforw= ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?") The routine cashing = in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray= ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L= ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour= nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with= in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl= e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th= e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio= nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. "When Wall Stre= et is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,= " says Carol Coale. "When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca= rry more weight." This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e= xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as = the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec= retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th= eir ways. "It just created an attitude," one executive still at Enron says.=  "If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th= ere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"=20 Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=  now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi= p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. "But," as=  one Houston oilman explains, "if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit= h someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati= on that's better suited for good times than bad." As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto= ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=  and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe= es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi= m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named = a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors= , and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and = everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but "innovat= e much closer to our core." As for the culture: "Things like the Performanc= e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate= gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo= rale problem." That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=  of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=  their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi= th Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie= ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh= en the company was in trouble, it was different. "Even Jeff's biggest detra= ctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door," one loyalist admits. But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. "Look," he s= ays with finality, "ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int= erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely." Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims= elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech= nologies. "The first wave never gets it right," he says. "The stand-alone d= ot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a secon= d wave that will change the world." Houston, he promises, will become the w= orld's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f= act, he is already shopping for office space. "This is the second wave, and Enron's got it," he says, almost breathless. = "There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g= et it."    Enron Fails to Smooth Things Over By Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com> Senior Columnist TheStreet.com 10/23/2001 01:07 PM EDT URL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10002864.html>  Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) held a special conference call Tuesday=  to address investor concerns that have weighed heavily on its stock.=20 But worries may persist after the energy trader offered few new details and=  the CEO publicly sparred with a gadfly investor over a shadowy off-balance=  sheet transaction.=20 The transaction that has drawn most attention in the past week is a complex=  financing that Enron entered into with a partnership called LJM2, which wa= s led by Enron's finance chief Andrew Fastow. Terminating this arrangement = led to a $1.2 billion equity reduction in the third quarter. Monday, Enron = stock plunged 20% after the company said the Securities and Exchange Commis= sion is probing "related party transactions." Executives declined to respon= d to questions about Fastow's role in the LJM2 partnership on the Tuesday c= all.=20 Another key issue is the impact of the equity reduction. The company said o= n the call that its share count would decline by 60 million in the fourth q= uarter, due to the termination of the LJM2 financing. But CEO Ken Lay said = the company wouldn't be increasing its earnings guidance of $1.80 a share f= or 2001 and $2.15 for 2002.=20 When a share count drops, earnings per share should normally increase, assu= ming the earnings number stays constant. The 60 million shares are equivale= nt to about 6.5% of the company's diluted total in the third quarter. As a = result, Enron should have raised its per-share profits forecast by about th= at much, assuming constant earnings.=20 When asked on the call if earnings per share guidance would be increasing, = CEO Lay replied that the company had previously increased its guidance for = this year. He then affirmed the 2002 number.=20 Now, to be fair, Enron may not be forecasting lower earnings. The planned r= eduction in shares may simply bring the total share count back close to a l= evel in the fourth quarter and 2002 that analysts had originally expected. = Notably, the share count in the third quarter jumped by 20 million, meaning=  a fourth-quarter reduction might not change matters that much. Alternative= ly, Enron may beat fourth-quarter estimates by 6.5%; perhaps the company ha= s simply chosen not to increase guidance at this stage, given uncertainties=  in the economy. In any case, more clarity on this matter is clearly needed= .=20 Calls to Enron weren't immediately returned. The stock edged up 2% Tuesday = after falling nearly 40% since last week amid worries about complex off-bal= ance sheet deals.=20 The call, arranged after Enron's Monday plunge, contained a lot of queries = about two trusts, called Marlin II and Whitewing, against which Enron borro= wed some $3.4 billion. Lay became testy after questioning by Richard Grubma= n of Boston-based hedge fund Highfields Capital Management. Grubman, who wa= s called an "a--hole" by Enron's former CEO Jeff Skilling on an April confe= rence call, was trying to find out the value of water assets held by Marlin=  II. The optimal way of paying back money borrowed through the trust is to = sell the water assets.=20 Grubman's line of questioning implied that the Marlin assets were worth onl= y about $100 million, meaning Enron would have to find about $900 million t= o pay off the Marlin II-related debt. Grubman arrived at $100 million after=  factoring in what he saw as the effects of a third-quarter writedown to wa= ter assets, some of which are included in Marlin II.=20 Lay disputed the $100 million number. At one point, he accused Grubman of d= riving Enron's stock down and monopolizing the Tuesday conference call. In = the middle of Grubman's comments, Lay told the call operator to go to the n= ext caller.=20 Grubman didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.=20 If Enron has to find $900 million, this can be done by issuing stock or rai= sing cash on its balance sheet. If the latter route is taken, Enron says it= 's likely to use asset sales to generate the cash. Enron executives said li= quidity would be sufficient and detailed at least $3.35 billion in availabl= e credit lines.=20 But if Enron's debt-to-capital ratio exceeds 65%, the covenants on some of = those lines are broken. After the $1.2 billion equity writedown and other c= harges taken in the third quarter, that ratio is probably about 50%-55% (En= ron hasn't released a third-quarter balance sheet to arrive at an exact cal= culation). It would take $3 billion in further writedowns or charges to pus= h Enron's debt-to-capital ratio up to 65%.=20  Stocks=20 More Static For Enron=20 Forbes.com staff, Forbes.com 10.23.01, 11:15 AM ET=20  NEW YORK - Enron scrambled again to reassure investors this morning, after = it disclosed yesterday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had=  asked for information on partnerships run by Chief Financial Officer Andre= w Fastow and other executives.=20  Enron (nyse: ENE ) last week reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million = after taking $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments.

Emshwiller Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal  10/25/2001 The Wall Street Journal A3 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  Enron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fasto= w, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock = price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major=  energy-trading companies.=20 Investors appeared worried that Enron's recent woes could have a destabiliz= ing effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, wit= h annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billi= on, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation's t= raded-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operat= ion, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for = the energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in trans= actions. "Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that," said Merrill Lynch an= alyst Donato Eassey. "There's not a trader out there that doesn't use Enron= Online." As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in = which the company's credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business = operations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consis= tently said it is financially strong and liquid.=20 Enron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-= old head of the company's industrial-markets division. His selection may be=  intended, in part, to raise the company's credibility. People familiar wit= h the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voic= ing concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow's role in running two limi= ted partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transac= tions with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and po= ssibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnershi= ps. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face=  of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street=  analysts and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Se= curities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transa= ctions.=20 While Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as=  the company's dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arran= gements clearly played a role in the executive's departure. "In my continue= d discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that rest= oring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO," said Ch= airman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement.=20 Enron said Mr. Fastow "will be on a leave of absence from the company." He = couldn't be reached for comment.=20 It remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow's removal will assuage an increas= ingly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. market=  close and followed a day in which Enron's stock once again plunged. As of = 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $= 16.41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board's most active list at ne= arly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-activ= e stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more= , possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron = stock.=20 Enron's shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier = this year, the stock was above $80 a share.=20 In an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies,=  which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, D= ynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A num= ber of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies muc= h different than Enron's, which rely heavily on complex and highly structur= ed investment vehicles.=20 Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow's departure could=  be seen as evidence that "management does care" about investor concerns. H= owever, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming a= s it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as "an admissi= on of guilt." Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron lar= gely because of uncertainties about the company's extremely complex financi= al structure.=20 Enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings= .=20 Worries and rumors about Enron's financial strength could be found in the s= tock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard = people voice concerns about a possible "death spiral" in which increasing c= redit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to d= o business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and le= ad to further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still = has a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn't yet seen any eviden= ce of such a problem.=20 However, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about=  its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other e= ntities. Enron is facing a problem with "trust and credibility. It's not ea= sy to regain something as basic as trust," he said.  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Looks at Dealings By FLOYD NORRIS  10/25/2001 The New York Times Page 2, Column 5 c. 2001 New York Times Company  The Enron Corporation, its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor conf= idence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who= se involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutin= y of the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20 ''In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear=  to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy = as C.F.O.,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in = a statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told in= vestors in a conference call that he and the Enron board ''continue to have=  the highest faith and confidence in Andy.'' The company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also = named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial market= s group and a former corporate treasurer.=20 Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night.= =20 The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, wh= ere Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half si= nce Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion=  reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships wi= th partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earning= s news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that fo= llowed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion=  write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered wh= en they later learned about it.=20 On Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with ana= lysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the=  transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr.=  Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the detai= ls of the transactions.=20 The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's=  disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand= .=20 By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron = stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would n= ot lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity=  that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the = S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected t= o address.=20 Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from=  complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts of= f its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either i= n cash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assure= d investors that the company ''expects to continue to have sufficient liqui= dity to meet normal obligations,'' and said it had bank credit lines that w= ere more than adequate.=20 Mr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, t= he former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in bu= siness strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an ene= rgy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its st= ock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75.=20 According to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's=  successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time wa= s the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving M= r. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMa= hon moved to a different job at the company, this person said.=20 Shares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest pri= ce for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours tradin= g, they fell to $16.14.=20 One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol=  Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to ''sell''=  from ''hold.'' She had lowered the rating to ''hold'' from ''buy'' on Mond= ay.=20 ''After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,'' she said in an interview yester= day evening, ''Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as=  a gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a=  little late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.''= =20 But she said that investor sentiment might work the other way.

During the third-quarter, Enr= on took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2=  billion reduction in shareholder equity.=20 Tuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously fo= llowed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected=  in dealings with the LJM partnerships.

Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to = issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entiti= es.=20 Investors wouldn't like that because it would dilute the value of current o= utstanding shares.

(ENE US= ) was downgraded to ``market perform'' from ``strong buy'' by analyst William=  J Maze at Banc of America.   Baring Asset Management's McClen on Enron: Investor Comments 2001-10-25 08:09 (New York)       London, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments by Catherine McClen, who helps manage about $17 billion of bonds for Baring Asset Management, about Enron Corp.       Yesterday, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into partnerships he ran that cost the largest energy trader $35 million. McClen said Baring bought credit-linked notes issued by Houston-based Enron during the summer.       ``Given what has happened, with them basically firing Andy Fastow, the CFO, they've finally woken up to how concerned people are about the management-credibility issue.'' On a recent conference call ``no one thought they did themselves any favor in terms of calming investors' concerns.''       ``They were slightly hiding behind the fact that the SEC has got this inquiry going. The fact that two days later Andy is gone, and he was in the center, is a good sign that the company is realizing just how concerned investors are.''       ``There's always that worry once the SEC gets involved that it could extend. You never know what could come of that.''       ``There is a bit of fear of the unknown about Enron now, with the SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset write-downs.''       ``Another thing they're criticized for is their lack of disclosure. We still haven't seen a balance sheet for the third quarter.''       ``People are saying, why don't you include a balance sheet with your results? They promised better disclosure in the past and that was meant to begin in the third quarter.''       ``You'd like to see just more information on asset write- downs and a discussion of their off-balance-sheet financing -- all these vehicles they have like Marlin and Osprey.''       ``We'd like to see some clarity, answering those sort of questions.''       ``It seems as though Enron at least are maybe at the start of a process where they're going to address and clean up their balance sheet and they've started to replace management.''       ``Investors have already had enough issues'' in corporate bonds recently and ``sometimes investors just think, `Not another nasty in my portfolio,' and I'd rather exit.''       ``For certain investors maybe they just get scared. I wanted to know more about it. People had speculated if it could go to junk. I don't think they could because I don't think Enron could exist as a junk company.''       ``There's a certain reluctance'' to sell the bonds. ``You want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals.''      ``When the spreads have already moved out that wide you have to reassess and see whether you think it's a buying opportunity.''  --Christine Harper in the London newsroom (44 20) 7330-7982 or charper@bloomberg.net /jom   Enron ousts CFO amid partnership questions By PAM EASTON Associated Press Writer  10/25/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001.

As details of this dea= l, and others, have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collap= sed, falling 54% in just seven days.=20 Wednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that=  once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of = once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that sc= ale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says F= astow is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, = formerly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group.=20 How might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's a= lleged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to=  show that the "Fastow era" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonym= ous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained=  about Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that = Fastow couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedl= y making a lot of money from LJM2.=20 Clearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for Enro= n. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's accoun= t of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct.=20 Not much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it too= k massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a=  difficult conference call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding back= ing. It took Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In oth= er words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much fu= rther does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at t= he company?=20 The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and=  Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was nec= essary to rebuild investor confidence.=20 Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shad= owy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading bu= siness makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolat= ion and without the knowledge of the board.=20 In fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed t= he LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broad= band business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come f= rom being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge=  that volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it acce= ss to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from t= he downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman re= sponds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had=  not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders.=20 Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views. = Arguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent=  on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad = has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an u= nhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The = spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transp= arency.=20 Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonde= r people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management?=20   Phew!

246,"Phillip, there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the same level of energy efficiency. I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. You say that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I just did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost was about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we can discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90 per sq. ft.  excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the true custom home level but should be achievable with good management.

Phillip, you have approved these documents prior to Tim and my input reflected below, which primary consist of showing how the Knowledge system is connected to the simulation system (Tim's idea with some direct guidance from me to Accenture on how to reflect this in the flow chart). Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt  In addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc  	After sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase: ?	Small story-line details (Example: company background, learner role) ?	Resources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report) ?	Order and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before)  Changes to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule.    Issue: Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. I have confirmed this with Accenture and they will send another email with this change, but I do not want to hold up acceptance since we are on our clock.   Thanks.

256,"Carlos,  Can you help me with several 1031 exchange questions?  I spoke to your office and they thought it best that I address my questions to you directly.    Here is my situation.  I purchased a 32 acre tract in Leander about 8 months ago.  I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th.    I expect to realize a gain of around $400,000.  See calculations below:  Sales price:		2,100,000 Purchase price		1,200,000 Fees&Devel costs	  500,000  Profit			 400,000  The cash generated at the sale will be close to $1 million after repayment of a loan.  I am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange.  I am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify.    First, there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner, Ltd for $1.15 million six months ago.  I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project.  We could not come to terms for the development, so the partnership was conveyed to me.  The loan still exist.  I am an 80% limited partner.  Another investor is the other limited partner.  We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner.  We intend to develop the property. Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange?  Second,  I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $400,000.  I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing.  I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually, but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP.  If neither of these deals qualify, I would still like to find another piece of property.  My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name.  Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different entity?  Thank you in advance for your help.

258,"Mike & Tony,  Rather than fill in the design selections, I have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs.  Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close.    I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.  Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.  If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.  I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.  We are torn between two good locations.  However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.  The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.  We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos.    I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.  Phillip Allen 713-463-8626 pallen70@hotmail.com",0,0,0
259,"Jennifer:  Mike Rabon had just forwarded to me this helpful synopsis of the opportunity  with Kinko's as he sees it.  I would like to forward this on to James  Thompson to assist him in targeting the right person for us to work with (and  cc Mike Rabon).  Is this a good idea to forward on the e-mail or is it  overkill given the e-mail I sent yesterday? Second, could I mention "Gary  King" Mike Rabon's Kinko's contact in the e-mail?  Thanks for your suggestion!  SJ     Mr. Thompson:  Here are several "touchpoints" identified by Mike Rabon, the Enron Broadband  Services originator, which may facilitate your finding the appropriate  broadband solutions architect at Kinko's.  You may recall having met Mike  Rabon in the October 6th meeting.   Kinko's has an IP network today with access to all branches.  Kinko's had  expressed the need to add more hubs to that network and make some changes to  it in the spring 2001 time frame.  Enron's goal would be to make a needs  assessment for the desired structure that Kinko's would like to see as it  pertains to: Near term network planning. IP Transport - Capacity requirements for Mbps, and burst potential. IP Transit - Capacity requirements and current contract usage for internet  transit. Kinkos.com in particular has a high potential for IP transit  capacity. Storage - As the hubs and branch numbers grow, there may be a need for  managed storage. Enron's solution will reduce, or eliminate the need to buy  storage devices. Mike Rabon would like to speak with someone at Kinko's about  your storage strategy and growth. Collocation - There is a substantial opportunity for Enron to provide the  actual space to be used for the hubs, as well as the IP transport from the  hubs. Interactive Video - Enron's IPNet Connect product will allow high quality  H.323 video conferencing at bandwidths well above 768K. Utilizing the Enron  IPNet Connect network installed to branches can allow video costs to be  significantly reduced, and allow much higher video quality.  Enron's  utilization of IP precedence will allow business traffic, internet traffic  and video traffic to traverse the same network.  Mike Rabon would like to  speak to the Video Conferencing product manager. Risk Management - Enron's expertise in Risk Management needs to be  communicated to the proper person.",0,0,0

The voting will take place through conference calls criss-crossing  the globe at 6.30 pm, Indian Standard Time. Even though the three Indian  lenders_ the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the State Bank of  India (SBI) and ICICI_ have decided to vote against the proposition, they  will not be able to block the move. Technically, the proposal can be passed if four per cent of lenders are in  favour of the termination notice. In effect, it will be passed if one of the  25 lenders casts its vote in favour of it. So, it's almost a foregone  conclusion that DPC will be asked to issue its termination notice.  Multilateral agency J-Exim, which has provided guarantees, will not  participate in the exercise. Barring J-Exim, other financial intermediaries  including global arrangers ABN Amro, Citi, ANZIB, CSFB and other banks and  OPIC will cast their votes tomorrow. "In the first round, Indian lenders put  their foot down and refused to give clearance to the termination notice.  Thistime around they will not be able to block the move any more. The Indian  lenders alone cannot save the controversial $3 billion as some of the foreign  lenders are in favour of issuing the termination notice," said a source. The  Indian lenders are in favour of completing the project without any time and  cost over-run. They have disbursed about 80 per cent of their Rs 1,500 crore  worth of loan commitments to phase II of the project, 93 per cent of which is  complete. The trial run is expected to commence in June. The board of the  Dabhol Power Company has already authorised Enron India managing director, K  Wade Cline, to serve a termination notice as and when he deems fit. At a  meeting of the lenders last month in London, the foreign lenders were keen  that the termination notice be served in the face of defaults by the  Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Union government's refusal  to honour the counter-guarantee of Rs 102 crore for the December bill. The  domestic lenders are not covered by the counter-guarantee if the contract is  terminated. The foreign lenders are covered by the counter-guarantee.  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co. (SCG) said in a  statement on Tuesday it will add around 200 million cubic feet a day, or  about six percent, to its pipeline system by the end of the year in order to  meet the surge in demand for gas-fired power generation.  Today's announcement comes two months after SCG, a unit of Sempra Energy ,  proposed to increase capacity on its system by 175 mmcfd, or five percent. Both projects will add around 11 percent of new gas capacity to its  transmission system this year, the company said in a statement.  In its latest proposal, called the Kramer Junction Interconnect, SCG said it  would build a 32-mile pipeline link to the Kern-Mojave pipeline system that  will allow it to deliver around 200 mmcfd into its system.  The new capacity would be enough to drive three 500-megawatt power plants or  enough gas to serve 1.4 million residential customers a day, the statement  said.  SCG, the nation's largest gas utility with more 18 million consumers in  central and Southern California, said utilization of its intrastate  transmission system in the past nine months had jumped from 75 percent to  over 95 percent, due largely to the rise in gas-fired power generation.  The company's announcement is the latest in several proposals to expand gas  pipeline capacity to California, where demand for gas is expected to jump  because of the number of gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for  construction.  Gas is already used to generate about a third of California's electricity.  And since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant  projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts.  Nine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than  6,000 megawatts, are under construction.  Over the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving  California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos' Kern  River Transmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave  Pipeline Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group,  Questar Corp. , Calpine Corp. , and Kinder Morgan .

Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity Market-Nikkei  05/15/2001 Dow Jones International News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  TOKYO (Nikkei)--Asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese  companies save as much as Y4 trillion, major U.S. energy firm Enron Corp.  (ENE) on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market  by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and  distribution, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported.  Enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power  plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to  households. If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to  match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector  could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said. At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company  asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity  auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant  benefits to end-users.  New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the  entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant  facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies.  Regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation  facilities asserted that "industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are  stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the  U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia."  In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which  last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity  supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a  company official.  Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to  spin off different operations, analysts say. If the number of power  generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's  electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business  interest.  Splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and  distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new  entrants. This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power  companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power  generation facilities, Enron says.  Citing the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector  has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution  must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.

Enron Agrees to Provide Market Data to NGX  05/15/2001 PR Newswire (Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)  CALGARY, May 15 /PRNewswire/ - NGX Canada Inc. (NGX), a wholly owned  subsidiary of OM AB (OM), today announced that an arrangement has been made  with Enron Canada Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (Enron),  whereby trading data from certain contracts listed on Enron's online trading  system, EnronOnline will be included in the computation of three Alberta Gas  Price Indices.  NGX acquired the AECO "C" & NIT Daily Spot, One-Month Spot, and Bid-Week Spot  gas price indices (Alberta Gas Price Indices) from Canadian Enerdata Ltd.  last September. Subsequent to the acquisition of the Alberta Gas Price  Indices, NGX has provided real-time information to its customers on the  establishment of the weighted average price indices based on transactions  conducted through NGX's trading system. Canadian Enerdata Limited continues  to publish the Alberta Gas Price Indices in the Canadian Gas Price Reporter. Peter Krenkel, President of NGX, stated, "We believe that inclusion of data  from EnronOnline will serve to make our price indices among the best in North  America. The industry has been very supportive of the visibility and  integrity we are able to bring to the Alberta Gas Price Indices, which  removes the guesswork around gas price index methodology. However, after  reviewing the matter with Enron and other industry participants, we  recognized that Enron had legitimate concerns and the industry felt that  "more is better". The inclusion of data from the highly liquid EnronOnline  system should improve the quality of our price indices even further."  Rob Milnthorp, President and CEO of Enron Canada commented, "We are very  pleased to have EnronOnline transactions included in the Alberta Gas Price  Indices. This will provide industry participants with a more comprehensive  source of data and a better opportunity to manage risk around these price  indices as they are now assured that all their transactions on EnronOnline  will be included in the computation of the Alberta Price Indices."  The inclusion of EnronOnline data satisfies the principal claims made by  Enron in their legal action against NGX, Canadian Enerdata Ltd., OM and  Richard Zarzeczny and Enron has agreed to discontinue the legal action  against those parties with the conclusion of this arrangement.  NGX and Enron are planning to implement the necessary system changes by  August 1, 2001 but in any event will provide at least thirty days notice to  the industry. Once in operation, data from transactions in the relevant  contracts listed on EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time. The  methodology for computing the Alberta Gas Price Indices will continue to be  on a weighted-average basis.  NGX will engage independent auditors to insure full compliance with the Index  Methodology Guide. This guide is available on NGX's website at www.ngx.com.

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- If U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) pulls out of the $3.5  billion Dolphin gas project, in which the company holds a 24.5% stake, the  U.A.E. Offsets Group, or UOG, will consider other companies to replace it, a  United Arab Emirates industry source close to the project said Tuesday.  Industry sources Monday said Enron is considering withdrawing from the  project because it doesn't believe it will be profitable. Dolphin, an agreement signed two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, plans  to bring 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore  North Field to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai.  Enron and TotalFinaElf (TOT) each hold a 24.5% stake in the project, while  UOG owns the remaining 51%.  Enron is set to focus on the midstream part of the project - gas  transportation - which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a  processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi  and the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai.  The U.A.E. source said originally, it was thought that the U.A.E. government  would fund the pipeline, which is estimated to cost around $1 billion.  However, more recently, the source said the U.A.E. suggested that Enron put  up the money itself.  Other industry sources said Enron and TotalFinaElf also had to pay  significant fees to join the project. TotalFinaElf will operate the upstream part of the project, which includes developing natural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field. First wells are  scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in  2005.   Last week, the Middle East Economic Survey reported that the foreign partners  haven't yet agreed on the precise details of their working relationship or on  the price of the pipeline.  Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of UOG, signed an  initial agreement in March for the upstream section of the project. A full  agreement is expected to be concluded in September, the source said.  -By Dyala Sabbagh, Dow Jones Newswires; 9714 331 4260;  dyala.sabbagh@dowjones.com  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2) 2001-05-15 16:35 (New York)  Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)       (Updates with closing share prices.)       Washington, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. should sell Portland General Electric Co. to Oregon so state consumers can be insulated from soaring electricity prices, a congressman said.      ``Purchasing PGE would give Oregon ratepayers more control by keeping its assets in Oregon, accountable solely to Oregonians,'' U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Springfield, Oregon, said in a letter to Governor John Kitzhaber.      The governor is considering DeFazio's proposal, said Kitzhaber spokesman Kevin Smith.      Last month, Houston-based Enron, the biggest energy trader, agreed to cancel the $3.1 billion sale of Portland General, a utility with more than 700,000 Oregon customers, to Sierra Pacific Resources of Reno, Nevada.      Enron and Sierra Pacific blamed laws spawned by high power prices and electricity shortages in the West for the sale's collapse.      ``We are pleased to keep Portland General in our asset portfolio because it's a solid earnings performer,'' Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said. ``If approached by a buyer who recognizes its value, we'd consider selling it.'' She declined to comment on a potential bid by Oregon.      The state should act swiftly, DeFazio said, citing press reports that the U.K.'s Scottish Power Plc, owner of PacifiCorp, the largest utility in the U.S Northwest, may bid for Portland General.      Scottish Power, based in Glasgow, Scotland, would have more than 70 percent of Oregon electricity customers if it added Portland General, raising ``serious regulatory concerns about market power,'' he said.                              Bond Issue       Oregon could issue bonds to purchase Portland General, using the utility's profits to pay the debt, DeFazio said. The state might run it as a public utility or a cooperative, he said.      Enron and Sierra Pacific called off the Portland General sale because of laws passed by Nevada and California legislators that slow the deregulation of their wholesale power markets.      California and Nevada have blocked sales of power plants by utilities. Sierra Pacific had to sell a stake in a Nevada power plant that sells power to California to win regulatory approval of the Portland General purchase.      Average power prices on the California-Oregon border this year have soared ninefold to $296.34 a megawatt hour over the year- earlier period. A megawatt hour can light 750 average California homes for an hour.      Shares of Enron fell $1.76 to $$56.99. They've fallen 31 percent this year.      Sierra Pacific rose 9 cents to $16.09. Scottish Power rose 9 pence to 492 ($7) in London.    Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1) 2001-05-15 16:26 (New York)  Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)       (Adds closing share price.)       Houston, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's biggest energy trader, agreed to provide natural-gas pricing information to NGX Canada Inc. and drop a C$100 million ($64.7 million) suit against the Canadian gas exchange.      Enron sued NGX in November after the Internet exchange, a unit of the company that owns the Stockholm Stock Exchange, changed providers of its gas-pricing data and didn't include trades on EnronOnline, Enron's Internet exchange, when calculating gas-price indexes.      Calgary-based NGX agreed to include EnronOnline trades in calculating its Alberta Gas Price Indices by August, Enron spokesman Eric Thode said.      NGX, owned by Stockholm's OM Gruppen AB, is used by about 90 percent of Canadian gas traders, and many traders use EnronOnline to sell gas from western Canada, the biggest supplier of the cleaner-burning fuel to the U.S.      Houston-based Enron fell $1.76 to $56.99.",0,0,0

By Per Jebsen  10/16/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.  NEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Energy and mining companies have provided a few glimmers of light but otherwise third-quarter results on Monday and Tuesday are helping to fulfill expectations for the worst quarter in 10 years.  Technology bellwethers Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. , which reported sharply lower profits, did little to buck the downward trend. FirstEnergy Corp. , an owner of electric utilities in northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected 18 percent increase in earnings, citing increased electricity sales and lower costs. Mining company Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. reported a third-quarter profit that reversed a year-earlier loss, due to higher gold production.  Yet such good news is proving more the exception than the rule. Top chipmaker Intel said on Tuesday after the close of exchanges that profits tumbled 77 percent as it suffered from slowing global economies and weak personal computer sales. PC maker IBM announced its first quarterly earnings decline since the end of 1999 as weak sales continued to weigh on profits.  Energy giant Enron Corp. posted a quarterly loss after taking $1.01 billion in charges. Companies from a range of industries reported profit shortfalls, including Caterpillar Inc. , the world's largest maker of construction equipment, and Unisys Corp. , a computer company.  "The earnings season is one that the market has digested and in some cases predigested as being just ugly, and therefore horrible or ugly results are not met with surprise at this point," said Michael Holland, who runs the $65 million Holland Balanced Fund.  FOCUS NOT ON EARNINGS  "The focus (for investors) has been and continues to be outside of earnings, that is, the war on terrorism specifically," he said.  Dynegy Inc. , a natural gas and power marketer and trader, on Monday said third-quarter earnings rose 62 percent as its backbone wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns. While Enron posted a loss, it reported that its profit excluding charges rose 35 percent due to strong performance in its core energy business.  "Energy companies manage to earn pretty good money even when prices are down," said Jon Burnham, portfolio manager for the $170 million Burnham Fund. "These are good, well-financed companies."  Caterpillar helped to lead a litany of earnings woes. The Peoria, Illinois-based company on Tuesday said its third-quarter earnings fell 5 percent because of higher expenses and less efficient manufacturing.  The company also said it expects fourth-quarter revenues to be down slightly from the year-ago quarter, with full-year profit down 10 percent to 15 percent. It blamed economic uncertainty in the wake of last month's attacks for the expected shortfall, but added that 2002 sales will be at least flat to up slightly from 2001 levels.  Unisys on Monday reported its third-quarter profits plunged by 50 percent due to weakening demand for high-end server computers and systems integration work. It said it would cut 3,000 jobs and slashed its fourth-quarter outlook.  TAKING GRIM TIDINGS IN STRIDE  Other companies that have reported profit drops include Novellus Systems Inc. , a maker of semiconductor production equipment, and Charles Schwab Corp. , the top U.S. discount brokerage. Schwab said Tuesday that quarterly earnings fell 51 percent as customers avoided stocks all summer, although a surge in September trading pointed to better times ahead.  Money managers are taking the grim profit tidings in stride.  "Most of these earnings situations are in these stocks," said Burnham. "Barring unforeseens in the national and international situation, the market should work its way higher over the next 6 to 9 months."  "Whatever earnings are in this quarter isn't going to matter too much, except in cases where they're considerably better than expected or worse," he said.  This week is the busiest for earnings with 15 Dow Jones industrial average and 180 Standard & Poor's 500 Index companies scheduled to report.  Profits for the companies in the index are expected to shrink by 22.8 percent, according to market research firm First Call/Thomson Financial, making it the worst quarter since the second quarter of 1991. That's down from an expected 6.2 percent decline at the beginning of the quarter, and a 14.7 percent drop expected on Sept. 10, said First Call analyst Joe Cooper.  Some 85 S&P 500 companies so far have reported quarterly results. Of these, 50 companies have beaten the most recent, often lowered Wall Street expectations while 26 have matched and nine have missed forecasts.  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved. 	  USA: INTERVIEW-Enron says may partner or sell broadband business.  10/16/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.  HOUSTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Energy giant Enron Corp. said on Tuesday it is reviewing strategic options for its loss-making broadband telecommunications business, which could involve selling the business or finding a partner.  "In addition to us looking at our business on a standalone business, we clearly have entertained some discussions on other possibilities," Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay told Reuters in a telephone interview. Earlier on Tuesday, Enron reported that one-time charges of $1.01 billion for broadband and other businesses outside its core energy operations pushed the company to a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, its first quarterly loss in more than four years.  Future options for the broadband business include "sale, partnership, all kinds of possibilities" he said.  "We still think over time that it will be a valuable business," Lay said, but for now the broadband market is in a "total meltdown", he added.  Enron's broadband unit, which owns an 18,000 mile network, posted a loss of $80 million for the third quarter, but Lay said losses should be smaller in subsequent quarters.  Enron launched its broadband business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential and has scaled down its operations.  Enron's stock rose by 87 percent last year, driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of the EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform.  But the stock has fallen some 59 percent so far this year as sentiment toward the broadband project soured, CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after only six months in the job and wrangling continued over Enron's stalled Dabhol power plan project in India.  Enron shares on Tuesday closed up 67 cents, or 2.02 percent, at $33.84.  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	  USA: UPDATE 6-Enron posts loss after taking $1 bln in charges. By C. Bryson Hull  10/16/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.  WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. on Tuesday reported its first loss in more than four years after taking $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments, including water and telecommunications services, which it said have clouded the strength of its core energy businesses.  Enron, North America's biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power, said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company's stock lost two-thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company. "What we've tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way," Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay said in a conference call.  Lay reassumed the CEO mantle at Enron after his successor, Jeff Skilling, resigned in August after only six months at the helm.  Houston-based Enron reported a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, or 84 cents a share, compared with net income of $271 million, or 34 cents a share, in the same period of 2000. It was Enron's first loss since the second quarter of 1997.  The charges covered the company's loss-making broadband telecommunications business, its troubled water affiliate Azurix, and New Power Co., Enron's retail electricity joint-venture with AOL/Time Warner and IBM.  Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade said it would probably take Enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a Wall Street favorite just 12 months ago.  "They do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting, they're a solid company, but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield," said Meade.  Enron's stock closed 67 cents higher at $33.84 on Tuesday, but for the year it is down about 59 percent, underperforming the Standard & Poor's utilities index .SPU), which has fallen some 23 percent over the same period.  ILL-FATED BUSINESSES  Originally a natural gas pipeline operator, Enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of U.S. energy markets to become the nation's dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity.  The company moved into the water services business in 1998 by acquiring Britain's Wessex Water and forming Azurix, a unit which Enron took public in 1999 but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled.  Enron helped set up New Power Co. and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about $28 per share to less than $2 as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated U.S. residential electricity markets.  Enron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential.  Enron's stock soared past sector peers last year when it posted a gain of 87 percent, driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform.  But the stock has fallen sharply this year as broadband sentiment soured, Skilling resigned and wrangling continued over Enron's stalled Dabhol power plan project in India.  Enron's third-quarter earnings before one-time charges rose to $393 million, or 43 cents a share, from $292 million, or 34 cents a share, meeting analysts' expectations of 42 to 45 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.  The company reaffirmed its previously stated earnings targets of 45 cents a share for the fourth quarter, $1.80 for all of 2001 and $2.15 for all of 2002.  DEBT ON CREDIT REVIEW  Rating agency Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday said it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade. The writedowns would reduce Enron's equity base, increase its nominal financial leverage and materially impact its earnings, Moody's said.  Enron's third-quarter earnings report showed that income at its wholesale marketing and trading division, the company's backbone moneymaker, grew 28 percent.  The division, which deals primarily in electricity and natural gas, saw pretax income rise to $754 million from $589 million in the third quarter of 2000.  All of the income growth in the segment came from Enron's gas and power trading and marketing operations in the Americas, where income grew to $701 million from $536 million last year.  The European segment, which includes gas and power operations there and other commodity sales like metals, coal and crude oil, remained flat at $53 million amid lower volatility.  The latest earnings report marked the first time that Enron has provided a financial breakdown of the European and Americas wholesale operations.  In doing so, Lay delivered on a promise he made after Skilling's departure: that he would make Enron's financial reporting more transparent. Many analysts and investors had grumbled about a lack of clarity from Enron.  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	  Enron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9) 2001-10-16 16:29 (New York)  Enron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)       (Adds in sixth paragraph that losses are equal to 70 percent of Enron's profits over the last four quarters. Closes shares.)       Houston, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, had a $618 million loss in the third quarter after expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales cost the company $1.01 billion.       The loss was 84 cents a share after payment of preferred dividends, Enron said. Net income a year earlier was $292 million, or 34 cents. Revenue rose 59 percent to $47.6 billion.       Investors have sent Enron stock down 60 percent this year on concern about investments outside energy trading and natural-gas pipelines. Some investors praised Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive officer, for acknowledging the failure of the new businesses. Others said they're not confident all the bad news is out.       ``What is disconcerting is that they didn't do this sooner,'' said Donald Coxe, manager of the $352 million Harris Insight Equity Fund. ``If you kill one cockroach in the kitchen, it doesn't mean there aren't more.''       Investors have questioned Enron's financial reporting in the past year, especially after Jeffrey Skilling's resignation as CEO in August. Skilling, who helped Lay transform Enron from a gas- pipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading, said he left for personal reasons. Investors said they weren't confident Enron was detailing all its problems.                           Failed Businesses       The $1.01 billion in losses, which total $1.11 a share, are equal to 70 percent of Enron's $1.45 billion in profits over the past four quarters.       Included were $544 million for losses on investments in New Power Co., a venture formed with AOL Time Warner Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. New Power competes for energy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power and gas suppliers as they do long-distance phone companies.       The $544 million also includes losses from the Enron unit that trades space, known as bandwidth, on fiber-optic networks, as well as for the ``early termination of certain structured finance arrangements'' with an undisclosed ``entity.'' Enron wouldn't be more specific.       Enron said restructuring the fiber-optic unit would cost another $180 million, including severance pay to 500 fired workers. The business collapsed this year along with the fortunes of the dot-com companies that were expected to be some off its biggest customers.       The declining value of assets owned by Azurix Corp., its water and sewage treatment business, will cost $287 million, Enron said.       Enron might take a first-quarter ``adjustment'' of less than $200 million because of accounting changes related to goodwill, Lay said in an interview. ``If we thought there were any other significant concerns, we would have taken care of them today,'' Lay said.                           Excluding Losses       Minus the losses, Enron would have earned $393 million, or 43 cents a share, up 35 percent from the year-earlier period. That matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.       Enron has averaged quarterly profit increases of 31 percent for the past year. Its wholesale services business, which includes energy trading, had income before interest, minority interests and taxes of $754 million, up 28 percent from a year earlier.      Shares of Enron rose 67 cents to $33.84. Earlier, the stock had risen as much as 5.2 percent to $34.90.       ``There's a sigh of relief that Enron's core businesses, its energy merchant businesses, are OK,'' said Roger Hamilton, who helps manage John Hancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares.       Enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the fourth quarter, $1.80 for the full year and $2.15 in 2002.                       `Ridiculous Investments'       At one time, Enron pinned high hopes on the businesses that contributed to the $1.01 billion in losses.       Enron spent $2.8 billion in 1998 for the U.K.'s Wessex Water, from which Azurix emerged. Enron sold shares to the public in 1999, and then bought back the company this year after Azurix failed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winning large projects. In August, Enron agreed to sell Azurix's North American business to American Water Works Inc. for $150 million.       In February 2000, Lay said trading bandwidth could become the company's fastest-growing business. In the latest quarter, the bandwidth unit's loss before interest, minority interests and taxes widened to $80 million from $20 million a year earlier.  Revenue plunged to $4 million from $162 million.       ``You can make the case that Jeff Skilling leaving was for the best,'' John Hancock's Hamilton said. ``Under him, they built the best trading operation while also making all these ridiculous investments.''       While admitting its poor choices, Enron also supplied more information this quarter about how it makes money. The company gave results of individual commodity-trading desks, including coal, forest products and steel.       ``I liked that they broke out the different commodities,'' Hamilton said. ``I think Lay has gotten the message loud and clear, and that the effort is there.''",0,0,0

Christina Cheddar  Dow Jones Newswires NEW YORK -- Although Enron Corp. plans to scale back its European operations, the Houston energy-trading company isn't looking to pare U.S. payrolls.  "There's nothing out of (the) ordinary planned for the rest of the business," said company spokeswoman Karen Denne. "We are continuing to hire in the businesses most rapidly growing."  Those growing businesses include Enron Wholesale Services, she said.  Earlier Thursday, Dow Jones Newswires reported the company would cut between 5% to 10% of its European staff, or as many as 500 workers.  This past summer, the energy company announced staff reductions at its Enron Broadband Services division. The number of employees affected by this decision wasn't immediately available, Ms. Denne said.  Before Thursday's announcement, the company's shares were trading lower on the New York Stock Exchange. But in afternoon trading today, shares of Enron (ENE) were up $1.11, or 3.3% to $34.60. With these latest gains, the stock is now up about 40% from the three-year low of $24.46 set a week ago.  For several months, Enron shares have been under pressure as investors struggled to assess the impact of a number of negative developments, including declining energy prices, the recent and sudden departure of its chief executive, disappointing performance of its broadband unit and difficulties at its Indian power plant project.  The stock has made steady progress this week as investors shopped for bargains or were encouraged by progress Enron made in its plan to divest itself of some overseas assets.  On Wednesday, Enron announced the sale of some Indian oil and gas assets to BG Group PLC (BRG), a United Kingdom oil and gas company.  J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin said the stock also received further support by the reaffirmation of earnings forecasts at rivals Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Aquila Inc.

(ENE) is looking to cut its workforce in Europe by up to 10%, or around 500 jobs, Enron Europe Chief Executive John Sherriff said Thursday.  "We have around 5,000 employees in Europe and we are seeking to cut our headcount here by between 5% and 10%, but we will aim as far as possible to achieve this through a program of voluntary severance," Sherriff replied in a written response to questions by Dow Jones Newswires. The cuts are the first significant retrenchment by Enron since it arrived in Europe in 1989. Enron has been the most aggressive U.S. energy company to expand into Europe's deregulating markets, but its core energy trading businesses have been held back by the slow and piecemeal progress toward market liberalization in the E.U.  The company declined to be more specific about how far it will scale back individual product lines or coverage of certain geographical businesses.   Enron's product range in Europe has mushroomed over the past year, continually giving rise to market talk, notably among its competitors, of overstretching itself prematurely in underdeveloped markets.  "Enron's business continues to grow in Europe in terms of traded volumes and numbers of transactions, but like any company we are constantly seeking ways to do more with less in order to maintain earnings growth," Sherriff said.  "It is prudent for us to keep both a close eye on our costs and to continually review the skills and resources that are available to use, to ensure that they are deployed in a way to maximize earnings," he added.  While trading volumes have exploded in core markets such as U.K. power trading since wholesale market reforms were introduced in March, liquidity in other products such as bandwidth, monomers and credit risk, is understood to have developed more slowly and restricted the volume growth needed to justify Enron's pure trading strategy.  Enron has been among the most prominent exponents of a new philosophy in energy markets that places far more emphasis on risk management skills than the physical ownership of assets, a radical change from the asset-heavy approach to energy that prevailed in Europe before the E.U.'s deregulation directive came into effect in 1999.  As such, it has in the last 18 months disposed of assets such as its stake in Sutton Bridge power station in England and has conspicuously refrained from buying 'brownfield' physical assets in markets such as Italy and Germany.  However, it has pursued various greenfield independent power projects and the acquisition of gas trading licenses in markets such as Spain and Italy.  -By Geoffrey T.

Acquisition Speeds Select Energy's Northeast Growth-Exec By Kristen McNamara Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  10/04/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Select Energy Inc.'s planned purchase of Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing Inc. will speed up by a year or two the company's plans to expand its business beyond New England to the entire Northeast, Select's president said.  The acquisition stengthens Select Energy's position in New York and the Mid-Atlantic, boosting its efforts to become a regional leader in the business of managing energy supply for industrial and commercial customers and trading electricity in the region. "We want to be the dominant player here," President William Schivley said in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires. "By being the dominant player in the Northeast, we'll be considered a national player."  Select, a unit of Berlin, Connecticut-based Northeast Utilities (NU), faces competition from national heavyweights like Enron Corp. (ENE), Duke Energy (DUK), AES Corp. (AES) and Exelon Corp. (EXC).  Select Energy announced an agreement Tuesday to purchase the wholesale and retail energy sales unit of Syracuse, New York-based Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc. (NMK), which is active in the Mid-Atlantic and New York power markets.  Integration plans aren't firm, but Select Energy will work with Niagara Mohawk executives to identify best practices from both companies, Schivley said.  The companies aim to have a transition plan ready by the time federal energy regulators rule on the combination. Select Energy has said it plans to keep Niagara Mohawk's Syracuse office open.  The company won't release the terms of the deal until it closes, which is expected in late November.  Select has annual revenues of about $2.5 billion. Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing had revenues of $635 million in 2000.  Select Energy is still looking at further acquisitions of trading operation and generating assets in New York and the Mid-Atlantic, Schivley said.  "This is more than just window shopping," Schivley said. "We are actively seeking out hard assets."  The company isn't interested, however, in the two other unregulated units Niagara Mohawk is looking to sell in advance of its acquisition by National Grid Group PLC (NGG), he added.  Within the next three to five years, more and more large companies are likely to start outsourcing management of their energy needs, especially as those needs become more complicated, Schivley said. Energy, along with labor and raw materials, are companies' three biggest expenses, he said.  "We're trying to grow this business by leaps and bounds," Schivley said. "We've taken a giant step in New York. All the products we offer will be expanded dramatically and increased to a number that, without the acquisition, would have taken us a year or two to get to."  -By Kristen McNamara, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2061; kristen.mcnamara@dowjones.com  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES   WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Members of the Pacific Northwest congressional delegation are gearing up in opposition to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's mandate for consolidation of power-grid assets in the region. The House Northwest Energy Caucus held an informal hearing late Wednesday to air concerns of utilities and industrial consumers in the region about FERC's effort to establish a regional transmission organization, or RTO.  The lawmakers plan to follow up the hearing with a letter to FERC voicing the concerns, which largely revolve around skepticism that the RTO will result in cost savings for the region's consumers.  FERC shouldn't force an RTO on the region without first conducting a cost-benefit analysis, said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., who is spearheading the effort.  Speaking with reporters prior to Wednesday's hearing, DeFazio complained that "a bunch of bureaucrats" at FERC are embracing the national power-grid agenda of Enron Corp. (ENE) without assessing the costs and regardless of "what it does for local reliability."  DeFazio's complaints were echoed in the testimony presented at Wednesday's hearing.  The region already enjoys an open and competitive transmission network, thanks to the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration, according to hearing testimony expressing concern that RTO West, as the RTO proposed for the region is called, will cost more to implement than it will provide in benefits.  "We are troubled that RTO West will not achieve any net benefit for end-use consumers in the Northwest," the Public Power Council testified. "Although work is beginning on a cost-benefit study, we are troubled that a transmission system that has served us all well for so long will be disassembled because FERC has announced that RTOs, by definition, are good."  "Regional transmission organizations may be necessary to remedy the transmission ills in other regions of the country, but not in the Northwest," declared a group of transmission-dependent utilities.  "The 'balkanization' and isolation of transmission systems that characterize most other regions is simply not present in the Northwest. For this reason, the economic power-side benefits of an RTO will be relatively small," said a group of aluminum producers.  Similar cost-benefit concerns have been voiced by state utility regulators in the Eastern U.S. who oppose FERC's effort to consolidate grid assets under large RTOs in the Southeast and Northeast.  'RTO Week'   FERC Chairman Pat Wood III acknowledged the complaints Thursday, adding that he expected to address the concerns of regulators and industry during "RTO Week" Oct. 15, when the commission will hold five days of hearings on the commission's RTO mandate.  "I think I need the decisionmakers at the table. We've had the lawyers in the suits arguing about it for eight years now," Wood said at an "energy community" forum sponsored by Enron in Arlington, Va.  Wood told Dow Jones Newswires following his remarks at the Enron forum that FERC answered the complaints about the lack of a cost-benefit analysis at its Sept. 26 meeting.  The commission agreed to undertake a comprehensive analysis in support of its claim that RTOs will bring about operational efficiencies that will translate into consumer savings.  Wood also noted a study by Mirant Corp. (MIR), which concluded that combining the three independent system operators in the Northeast into a single RTO would produce $440 million in annual consumer benefits.  During the Enron forum, Edward Meyers, a regulator with the District of Columbia Public Service Commission, urged Wood to seek out the input of affected state regulators.  Meyers noted that he is in the minority among regulators in the region in supporting the Northeast RTO grid-consolidation, while most others oppose the effort as "economically dangerous."  Arnetta McRae, chairman of the Delaware Public Service Commission, told Wood that her fellow state regulators aren't so much opposed to grid regionalization but the lack of consultation by FERC.  The state regulators want "an opportunity to be at the table," McRae said. If such a process were offered, there would be a lot less opposition, she predicted.  FERC is reaching out to address the concerns of state regulators, Wood said, adding that he was "blindsided" by the opposition among state regulators to FERC's grid-consolidation mandate.  Later in the day, Wood told reporters that "RTO Week" will feature an entire hearing devoted to the concerns of state regulators.  At the Enron forum, Wood defended the commission's RTO policy, which calls for carving up the nation's interconnected electricity system under the control of four or five large RTOs, as necessary to jump-start the overly long transition from regulation to competition.  "This process needs to be goosed," said Wood, calling FERC's RTO orders "an external catalyst" to get the process moving.  "If I'm wrong, I'd love to find a better way around that," he said.  -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647; Bryan.Lee@dowjones.com  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	  USA: NewPower signs up 50,000 new electric users in Texas.  10/04/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.  NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The New Power Co. said Thursday the electricity grid operator in Texas is processing requests from over 50,000 residential customers who have chosen New Power as their new electricity provider.  The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) is responsible for processing the requests to switch customers for all utilities and competitive retail electric service providers during the state's deregulation pilot program, NewPower said in a statement. The switching process could take anywhere from two weeks to two months before consumers will actually begin to receive power from a competitive retail electricity provider.  New Power said it has captured more than half of the customers who decided to switch to new providers from the Reliant Energy HL&P and TXU Corp. markets.  The New Power Co., a subsidiary of NewPower Holdings, Inc. , is the first national provider of electricity and natural gas to residential and small commercial customers in deregulated power markets in the United States.  The Texas pilot power deregulation program began on July 31 after it was delayed two months due to computer problems.  The entire state is slated to begin full retail competition on Jan. 1, 2002.  A spokesman for the Public Utility Commission of Texas told Reuters previously that about 120,000 residential customers had signed up for the pilot program.

JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer  10/04/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.  WASHINGTON (AP) - North Carolina and several other states told the Supreme Court the government went too far when it ordered electric utilities to open their power lines to competitors and spurred a movement toward deregulation.  But one of the country's largest power marketers, Enron, argued before the court Wednesday that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should have gone even further to help companies like Enron get equal access to power grids. During the hourlong hearing, the justices gave little indication of how they will decide on a case that could dramatically affect management of the nation's power grids and the future of electricity competition.  At one point, Justice Stephen Breyer said FERC, which regulates wholesale power markets and interstate transmission of power, was being "whipsawed" from both directions.  The commission's 1996 decision, which for the first time required traditional utilities to open their transmission lines to competing power merchants, triggered a movement toward wholesale electricity competition and led numerous states to end monopolies in retail power markets.  But utility regulators in nine states, led by New York, filed suit arguing that the FERC order amounts to a federal agency attempting to regulate retail sales, usurping a traditional state function.  At the same time, Enron's lawsuit charged that FERC violated federal law because it did not require access to transmission lines when utilities continued to keep transmission and retail sales as one operation - as remains the case in many states that have yet to allow competition.  In June 2000, an appellate court essentially upheld FERC's regulation, prompting appeals from both Enron and the state regulators.  "It's an example of where an agency has overstepped its bounds," Lawrence Malone, general counsel for the New York State Public Service Commission, told the justices at Wednesday's hearing. The other states party to the lawsuit are Florida, Idaho, New Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia, Washington, Vermont and Wyoming.  Malone, appearing on behalf of all nine states, argued that FERC's order pre-empts state authority to regulate retail sales and set rates.  "This case isn't about rates," countered Louis Cohen, representing Enron Power Marketing Inc. before the court. "What we're concerned about is getting onto the (grid) system."  Cohen said that under the current access rules a dominant utility in a state that has not moved to competition may still "hog" the lines and keep Enron and similar marketers from moving power across a region.  The Justice Department, representing FERC before the court, argued that the commission only sought to strike a balance between the need to give competitors equal access to power lines and leaving retail market issues to the states.  Edwin Kneedler, deputy solicitor general, told the court that FERC, in his view, could have gone further, as Enron has argued. But, he said, to do so it would first have had to order all utilities to separate retail sales and transmission, something it chose to leave to the states.  The case, which is not expected to be decided until sometime next year, comes at a time of growing concern about electricity competition and power grid reliability in light of recent power problems in California.  About half of the states have taken some steps toward retail electricity competition.  Many power industry experts as well as the FERC commissioners have emphasized that a truly competitive electricity market will be difficult to achieve without smooth and efficient flow of electricity across large regions, if not nationally. And that, argue companies like Enron who want to compete with traditional utilities, will require more open access to transmission.  In an attempt to smooth the flow of power, FERC has embarked on a campaign to establish four large, regional transmission organizations to manage the national power grid. A court decision rolling back some of FERC's authority over open access to transmission lines could affect that effort.  Uncertainty over how far the federal government will be allowed to go in requiring transmission access also could affect state decisions on whether to embrace electricity competition, according to some industry experts.  ---  On the Net:  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission: http://www.ferc.fed.us/  Enron: http://www.enron.com/corp/  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com. IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center. We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com. Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.  Enron Messaging Administration",0,0,0
278,"FYI, It has been a valiant effort but as soon as we free up space on the Notes  server it fills back in.  So as a result we will be shutting down the notes server tonight from 8:00 PM  until 12:00 AM to rebuild the data drives. This will provide more space to  work with and allow for room to grow. We will also be turning on a purge agent in 2 weeks that will eliminate mail  from your Inbox, Sent Mail and Trash after it reaches 30 days of age. Please shut down Lotus Notes before you leave to night to help ensure we do  not lose any data.  Thanks, Mike Mc.",0,0,0

291,"Jeff,   The release that Jacques prepared provides for the payback of any utilities that I have been paying since 4/20.  You might mention to them that we need to get the utilities settled up before we pay the $11,000.  It might be a good idea to go ahead and have the utilities transferred so we can get the final amount since 4/20.  Also May 20th was supposed to be the 1st payment on the two notes.  But I have not received payment on either.  Let's try and wrap this up this week.  Phillip   -----Original Message----- ",0,0,0

Davis, who has resisted such a move, sees a chance= =20 of more blackouts.=20  By MIGUEL BUSTILLO and DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writers=20  ?????SACRAMENTO--State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned Wednesday that he=20 cannot sell a record $10 billion in bonds to finance purchases of electrici= ty=20 unless the state reveals the price it is paying for power--something Gov.= =20 Gray Davis has refused to do. ?????The warning came as Davis acknowledged that his efforts to secure enou= gh=20 electricity to meet demand could fall short, raising the possibility of mor= e=20 blackouts. ?????"The real crunch," Davis said Wednesday, "will be in May and June and= =20 late April"--much earlier than the usual peak in August, September and earl= y=20 October. Angelides said he cannot secure the largest municipal bond offerin= g=20 in American history until Wall Street can see what California is spending o= n=20 power and what it expects to spend in the future. ?????"You can't go to the marketplace to sell $10 billion in bonds and say,= =20 'We don't have a public plan,' " Angelides said. ?????Angelides announced that he has secured $4.1 billion in short-term=20 "bridge" financing to repay the state for power purchases until the bonds a= re=20 issued. That deal remains clouded, in part by the utilities' resistance to= =20 using customer payments to repay the bonds promptly. ?????The governor is scheduled to give a five-minute televised address on= =20 energy at 6:05 tonight, expected to be carried by all Los Angeles televisio= n=20 stations. ?????In addition to discussing the potential for more blackouts, Davis is= =20 expected to outline his efforts to expand power production, renew his call= =20 for Californians to cut electricity use and address the question of rate=20 hikes. ?????"I'm certainly going to share with [Californians] the progress we've= =20 made and what we have to do together over the near term to get through this= =20 challenge," Davis told reporters. " . . . We have to accept responsibility= =20 for solving the problem. I'm going to lay out exactly how to do that." ?????Sensing the urgency, the Legislature spent much of Wednesday pushing= =20 forward a $1.2-billion package of conservation bills crucial to helping=20 California escape widespread power outages during the hot season. ?????And in another move to boost summer supplies, the California Energy=20 Commission approved two "peaking plants" under a new fast-track, 21-day=20 permit process ordered by Davis. ?????Designed to produce power to meet sudden demand, such plants are a maj= or=20 part of the governor's plan to help avert blackouts this summer, and=20 commissioners approved them unanimously. But they expressed qualms about th= e=20 vague standards in place for the plants--one to be built near San Diego, th= e=20 other in Palm Springs--in part because the facilities have been exempted fr= om=20 the usual environmental reviews. ?????Most experts assume that peaking plants are pressed into service only= =20 when demand for electricity is highest. But the facilities approved Wednesd= ay=20 are capable of operating for as much as 85% of the time. ?????The partnership that owns the plants--a venture between Shell Oil and = an=20 arm of engineering giant Bechtel Enterprises--is in talks to sell electrici= ty=20 to the state for 10 years or more. But current contracts call for the sale = of=20 500 hours of electricity for the next three years, said John Jones, a=20 representative of the partnership. ?????The company would sell the rest of its electricity on the open market,= =20 presumably at higher prices--and not necessarily in California. ?????Suggesting that the facilities may not fit the definition of peaking= =20 plants, outgoing Commissioner Robert Laurie called for more public disclosu= re=20 about the implications of Davis' emergency order. ?????"They may be large; they may be small," Laurie said. "They may operate= =20 300 hours; they may operate 8,000 hours."  ?????Measures Focus on Cutting Consumption ?????The conservation bills that lawmakers addressed Wednesday--supported b= y=20 environmentalists and the business community alike--represent the largest= =20 such investment in history and are designed to get Californians to cut ener= gy=20 consumption this summer. ?????The measures would provide everything from rebates for buyers of new,= =20 efficient refrigerators to free power-saving lightbulbs for poor people. Al= l=20 told, the measures are expected to save California roughly the amount of=20 electricity produced by eight power plants. ?????Legislators had hoped to get the bills to the governor's desk by the e= nd=20 of this week, but some turbulence slowed the progress. ?????The trouble began Tuesday, when Assembly Democrats and Republicans fro= m=20 agricultural areas said they would not vote for the Senate bill, SB 5X, unt= il=20 it was amended to include programs to help agriculture. Concluding that=20 opposition might stall the bill in the lower house, Assembly leaders agreed= =20 to the amendments, including one that protects agribusiness from blackouts. ?????That move infuriated the bill's author, Sen. Byron Sher (D-Stanford),= =20 and started a war of words between the houses. ?????"What they did and the way they did it I found a little untoward," sai= d=20 Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco), calling the agricultural=20 interests "greedy." ?????In the end, the bill cleared the Assembly by a vote of 74 to 1=20 Wednesday. It now returns to the Senate. A second conservation bill, AB 29X= =20 by Assemblywoman Christine Kehoe (D-San Diego), containing more than $400= =20 million more for conservation programs, also awaits action there. ?????While the governor has been pushing for the bills, their price tag=20 exceeds what he has pledged to spend on conservation, and he is expected to= =20 trim the legislation once it arrives on his desk.  ?????Concerns About Depleting Treasury ?????Angelides, meanwhile, sent a letter to Davis outlining his problems in= =20 issuing the $10 billion in bonds needed to repay the state for the power it= =20 has been buying on the spot market. To avert mass blackouts, California mad= e=20 its risky foray into the power-buying business in January after the state's= =20 two largest utilities said they were nearly bankrupt and generators would n= o=20 longer sell to them. ?????The state has been buying power at the rate of roughly $50 million a= =20 day. A Davis-sponsored plan calls for the $10 billion in bonds to repay the= =20 state; the bonds, in turn, would be retired by utility customers through=20 their monthly bills. ?????That plan was based on the premise that the state would be able to=20 stabilize, and eventually lower, the price of electricity by entering into= =20 long-term contracts with power suppliers. Those lower prices have yet to=20 materialize, raising increasing questions about whether $10 billion will be= =20 enough. ?????"I think there is no doubt that if we continue to chunk out general fu= nd=20 money without end, what's going to happen is that we're going to deplete ou= r=20 treasury, we're going to harm the very programs that we care most about, an= d=20 our credit rating will come down," Angelides said. ?????The governor's finance director, Tim Gage, said such fears are=20 unfounded. Officials have planned all along to release some details on=20 California's power purchases to the Public Utilities Commission so the pane= l=20 could determine how much money is needed to repay the bonds, he said: "I=20 would think that any information required to sell the bonds will be provide= d.=20 . . . I don't know how specific it's going to have to be." ?????Also on Wednesday: ?????* The Assembly and Senate passed a bill placing price caps on large=20 power users in San Diego, currently the only area in California where some= =20 are feeling the full sting of the deregulation law adopted in 1996. San Die= go=20 was the first and only area where state regulators lifted price caps, the= =20 expected outcome of deregulation. The result last summer was that bills=20 doubled or tripled virtually overnight. ?????The bill, SB 43 by Sen.

Homeowners and other small= =20 consumers are protected under legislation approved last year. ?????* Lawmakers in both houses announced legislation that would place a=20 windfall profits tax on power companies that sell electricity to California= =20 at excessive prices. "It's time to gouge the gougers," said Assemblywoman= =20 Dion Aroner (D-Berkeley), a sponsor of the Assembly proposal. ?????In the upper house, a bill (SB 1X) that would tax power producers'=20 profits at an unspecified rate and rebate the money to taxpayers cleared it= s=20 first committee hurdle.

The administration has= =20 become more defensive about criticism that it has left California on its ow= n=20 to solve its crisis. ?????Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), the influential chairman of the House energ= y=20 and air quality subcommittee, said he is splicing together the emergency=20 legislation and hopes to introduce it when Congress returns from the Easter= =20 recess. ?????"We can't just say, 'Let California take care of California,' " Barton= =20 said at an energy conference in Washington. ?????Although the bill will not contain the price caps sought by Democrats= =20 and a handful of Republicans, Barton said in an interview that he will allo= w=20 amendments in support of price controls during committee deliberations. ?????"They will have a chance to see whether the votes are there," Barton= =20 said. "I don't think the votes are there, but I see no reason why [supporte= rs=20 of price controls] can't have the full right to offer an amendment." ?????A list circulated by GOP staff in recent weeks includes a range of ide= as=20 such as relaxing environmental rules, subject to a governor's request;=20 increasing federal energy assistance to low-income consumers; firing up=20 mothballed power plants; and directing federal facilities to reduce energy= =20 use by 10%. ?????Some of the ideas are more practical than others. Referring to a=20 proposal to connect nuclear ships to the electricity grid, Barton said: "Do= =20 you really want a nuclear aircraft carrier that might need to be dispatched= =20 to the South China Sea tied up to the grid in San Diego?" ?????On the issue of relaxing clean air rules--another sensitive point for= =20 Democrats--Barton said his bill would not make permanent changes in=20 environmental requirements. Instead, it would grant governors the flexibili= ty=20 to allow power plants that have exceeded emissions limits to temporarily ke= ep=20 operating during emergencies. ?????That, he contended, would be less harmful than one likely alternative:= =20 individuals and companies relying on their own generators during blackouts.= =20 "It doesn't make a lot of sense to allow diesel generators to kick in and= =20 shut down units that use natural gas," Barton said. ?????Separately, Sen. Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska), chairman of the Senate=20 Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has asked for an inventory of all= =20 possible energy sources in the West and "what actions will be necessary to= =20 bring those sources online or increase their current generation." ?????But Democrats said that without price controls, Republican-sponsored= =20 bills would be of little help this summer to California. ?????"If it doesn't provide wholesale price caps, it doesn't do what is=20 needed to help California," said Phil Schiliro, chief of staff for Rep.

"Flip the switch and= =20 pray the lights come on, and that you'll be able to afford the bill at the= =20 end of the month," he said. ?????The administration contends that price controls will discourage=20 investment in new power plants.

But doubts remain on how long the region can benefit from its federa= l=20 dams.=20  By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer=20  ?????PORTLAND, Ore.--As California searched last summer for surplus=20 electricity to keep its air conditioners humming, the Bonneville Power=20 Administration stepped forward to help. ?????How much did the marketing agency charge for each of the 489,000=20 megawatt-hours it shipped south, power generated by the massive federal=20 hydropower dams in the Northwest? ?????If you guessed $22.39, the amount BPA charges public utilities in=20 Seattle, think again. The average price was three times that. And at the=20 height of the power-marketing frenzy, Bonneville got $750 a megawatt-hour, = 33=20 times what public utilities and private firms in the Pacific Northwest were= =20 paying. ?????As power generators throughout the West profited from California's=20 energy appetite last year, so too did Northwest customers: BPA netted $400= =20 million from sales to the Golden State, which helped hold down rates for=20 private electricity users here who already pay the lowest rates in the=20 nation--half of what Californians pay. ?????And major aluminum, steel and chemical companies across the=20 region--which not only pay lower rates but also have the right to purchase= =20 certain allotments of energy produced by the federal dams--stand to pocket= =20 $1.8 billion in the next few months by reselling or exchanging their shares= =20 so Bonneville can help California out of its crisis. ?????How long, Northwestern politicians wonder, can the region hold onto th= e=20 exclusive benefits of a multibillion-dollar network of 29 federal dams on t= he=20 Columbia and Snake rivers--legendary edifices such as Bonneville and Grand= =20 Coulee? ?????How long, others ask, should it be able to? ?????California's two Democratic senators--Dianne Feinstein and Barbara=20 Boxer--have questioned the fairness of locking in low power rates "for a=20 select group of consumers, to the detriment of tens of millions of others= =20 whose taxes also paid for the facilities that generate and manage that powe= r=20 source." ?????Said David Luken of the Edison Electrical Institute, a coalition of=20 investor-owned utilities: "It would be as if California took all the revenu= es=20 from offshore oil and used it to hold down gasoline prices in Los Angeles." ?????Critics estimate that BPA routinely sells its power to customers in th= e=20 Northwest for about $1 billion a year less than it could earn at market=20 rates. Last year, the gap spread to about $3 billion. The BPA is the major= =20 reason homeowners in Seattle are paying 5.4 cents a kilowatt-hour for=20 electricity; Southern California Edison customers pay 10.2 cents. ?????After suspending sales to California late last year because the power= =20 the BPA was able to generate in the face of an extreme drought was needed i= n=20 the Northwest, the agency briefly resumed sending electricity south last=20 month--dispatching between 600 to 1,000 megawatts an hour for about eight= =20 days between March 7 and March 21. ?????Although officials would not disclose the negotiated price, the market= =20 rate for power then ranged from $210 to $350 a megawatt-hour. ?????Despite the windfall sales to California, however, the BPA has its=20 problems. With contracts to deliver much more power than it can generate, B= PA=20 has said it would have to institute rate increases totaling $3 billion a ye= ar=20 or more unless it can wean substantial blocs of customers off of federal=20 power. ?????The belt-tightening threatens the region's aluminum industry and=20 ratepayers in Washington state, Oregon, Montana and Idaho--some of whom=20 already have seen their electric bills rise 50% or more over the last few= =20 months. ?????The looming fiscal emergency is so severe that Oregon Gov. John=20 Kitzhaber recently proposed seeking a temporary reprieve from most of BPA's= =20 annual $732-million debt repayment. That is money to reimburse federal=20 taxpayers, who funded the region's massive system of concrete and generator= s. ?????Most Northwestern political leaders are loath to miss a Treasury=20 payment--as many believe that would leave the agency ripe for plunder. ?????That is the region's greatest fear: that California's hefty=20 congressional delegation will make a grab for the agency's power. ?????The debate over who controls BPA--and who benefits from it--promises t= o=20 emerge as a key question before Congress as the West's energy woes continue= . ?????Several Northwestern legislators have proposed buying BPA back from th= e=20 federal government in an attempt to lock in benefits for regional ratepayer= s.=20 Congressional lawmakers last year countered with a proposal to force=20 Bonneville to sell low-cost power to private utilities in California. Some= =20 also proposed auctioning BPA power at market rates--ending the cost-based,= =20 regional-preference formula. ?????BPA contracts with about a dozen users--companies such as Alcoa, Kaise= r=20 and Reynolds--that have guaranteed the energy-intensive aluminum industry= =20 access to a fifth of Bonneville's power at rates lower than those paid by= =20 other customers have come under particular scrutiny. ?????The contracts are so lucrative that Kaiser is expected to earn up to= =20 $500 million this year by shutting down its factories and remarketing its B= PA=20 power allocation. ?????BPA cites the aluminum industry's value as a reliable, steady-load=20 buyer--as opposed to residential utilities, whose fluctuating loads are=20 harder to serve. ?????But Seattle energy analyst Kevin Bell calls the industry contracts "an= =20 incredibly bad deal." Unable to generate enough power to meet its=20 commitments, the BPA has been forced to buy power on the open market at 40= =20 cents a kilowatt-hour, supply it to firms such as Kaiser for 2 cents, and= =20 watch Kaiser sell it again for 40 cents. ?????It is, in fact, only the recently deregulated electricity market that= =20 has made BPA power an attractive deal. In the mid-1990s, clients were=20 flocking away from Bonneville to cheaper generators. Aluminum companies at= =20 the time agreed to prices that were higher than what was available elsewher= e,=20 gambling that the market price would go up. ?????"If we're going to talk about why Bonneville has preferential rates in= =20 the Northwest, shouldn't we also talk about why California has preferential= =20 rates for federal power in California?" said acting BPA administrator Steve= =20 Wright. "Federal policy is, in general, the indigenous electrical power=20 resources in a region are dedicated to the loads in that region. The power= =20 from Hoover Dam goes to the people in the Southwest. The Central Valley=20 Project goes to people in Northern California." ?????Bonneville for years has enjoyed a mutually beneficial power exchange= =20 with California. Although the agency often profits from surplus power sales= =20 to California, the majority of the power it has sent south over the years h= as=20 been either at low, long-term rates to such cities as Burbank, Glendale and= =20 Pasadena, or as part of an exchange program in which California returns twi= ce=20 as much as it borrows. ?????And while Bonneville ratepayers profited from the brief period of=20 sky-high wholesale power rates last summer, its sales represented less than= =20 1% of the California power market and probably had the effect of lowering,= =20 not raising, overall market rates, BPA officials said. ?????Indeed, Bonneville often sold power to California at less than its own= =20 cost-based rates during the first two years of deregulation after 1998. ?????And Northwestern legislators point out that the hydropower dams, for a= ll=20 their advantages, have come at considerable cost to the region: Two wild=20 rivers now are throttled. The price for trying to bring back endangered=20 salmon has reached nearly $4 billion so far, most of it borne by BPA=20 ratepayers. ?????The question of sharing the hydropower bonanza outside the Northwest= =20 never came up until the 1960s--with the construction of two major power=20 arteries linking Bonneville's transmission grid with California. The=20 846-mile-long link between Celio, Ore., and Sylmar is the world's biggest= =20 direct current power line. ?????Before agreeing to the transmission links, Northwestern politicians=20 insisted on a "regional preference" for BPA power, giving the Northwestern= =20 states first crack at power generated on the Columbia. ?????It is no different today. ?????"Unless we control the destiny of Bonneville, we're not going to contr= ol=20 the Northwest region," said Oregon state Senate President Gene Derfler, who= =20 has proposed a regional takeover of BPA. "California is definitely a threat= =20 at this point. They would take our power, all of it, and say, 'Thank you.'= =20 And what are we going to do about it? They have 52 congressmen; the Northwe= st=20 states have 15."  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- ---------------------------------------------------------------  Davis Campaign Losing Steam=20 Energy crisis generates possible challengers for governor in 2002=20 Carla Marinucci, John Wildermuth Thursday, April 5, 2001=20 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle=20 URL:=20 http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/chronicle/archive/2001/04= /05/M N113404.DTL=20 Until this week, most Democrats simply scratched their heads over talk abou= t=20 who might be crazy enough to launch a primary challenge to Gov.

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES   WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Any merger deal that may emerge between Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Enron Corp. (ENE) will face a complicated and time-consuming regulatory-review process, legal experts said Thursday. Any equity deal would require approvals from numerous U.S. federal regulatory agencies and state utility regulators, as well as survive Canadian and European antitrust reviews, energy attorneys contacted by Dow Jones Newswires said.  A merger would require approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission. And the Illinois Commerce Commission likely would weigh into the mix, since Dynegy owns Illinova's Illinois Power Co.  Any effort to strike a deal quickly also could be complicated by Enron's ownership of Portland General Electric Co. While Enron has entered into an agreement to sell the utility to Northwest Natural Gas Co. (NWN), a previous attempt to sell the company fell through because of regulatory complications.  A key issue for federal regulators scrutinizing a potential Enron-Dynegy merger will be the degree of electricity market concentration such a transaction would entail, the attorneys said.  Financially wounded Enron is the nation's largest electricity and natural gas trader with an extensive network of gas pipelines.  Dynegy is ranked sixth nationally in both electricity and natural gas marketing.  The transaction would receive the greatest scrutiny at FERC, where the merger application would challenge the commission's merger-review policy, attorneys said.

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices mostly fell Thursday, dipping on low demand and a shorter-than-usual trading session as Enron's online trading service went off the board, traders said.  With Dynegy and Enron Corp. talking takeover matters, traders felt Enron's gas traders simply covered positions and got out of the market quickly. Marketers felt Enron's trading positions have eased in the last two weeks as the company reported a $1.2 billion erosion of investor equity related to questionable partnerships. Also, traders pointed to no incremental or storage demand and a lack of weather-driving prices downward.  Fundamentals for the market remain bearish: Storage is near all-time highs, and injection season ended with Wednesday's 10 billion cubic feet build. Otherwise, some floor traders said gas marketers were shying away from trading with giant Enron Corp.  December settled Thursday at $2.960 per million British thermal units, up 9.0 cents. Traders are looking ahead hopefully to colder weather at the end of the month, in time for the Thanksgiving holiday.  At the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana, traders paid $2.60-$2.77/MMBtu, down 1 cent-8 cents. First-of-month November index is $3.16/MMBtu, traders said.  Deals at Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Station No. 65 were done at $2.60-$2.74/MMBtu, down 5 cents-8 cdents. November first-of-month index is $3.19/MMBtu, a trader said.  At the Arizona-California Border, where gas from El Paso's pipeline begins delivery to Southern California, buyers paid $2.54-$2.65/MMBtu, up 1 cent on the bid, down 2 cents on the offer as traders feared curtailments on the pipeline. November first-of-month index is $2.95/MMBtu.  At the Katy hub in East Texas, buyers paid $2.56-$2.74/MMBtu, down 7 cents on the bid, up 3 cents on the offer.

USA: NewPower shares advance on revised guidance.  11/08/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - National power and gas marketer NewPower Holdings Inc. revised its 2001 loss guidance downward on Thursday and saw its stock post its best one-day gain in two months.  The projection came in NewPower's report of a third quarter net loss of $67.1 million, or $1.15 per share, compared to a net loss of $69.9 million, or $2.96 per share for the third quarter of 2000. Analysts had expected a per-share loss of $1.15 to $1.18, according to research firm Thomson Financial/First Call, which put the consensus at $1.16.  Purchase, New York-based NewPower is the parent of The New Power Co., which says it is the first national provider of electricity and natural gas to residential and small commercial customers in the United States. It said total customers increased 155 percent to 805,000 compared to the third quarter of 2000. Revenues were $54.7 million in the latest quarter, an increase of 201 percent from the third quarter of 2000.  During the third quarter, NewPower said, it gained about 80,000 new customers through the company's marketing efforts, primarily in the residential sector. NewPower recently increased its emphasis on small business customers and at the end of September had over 25,000 small business accounts. NewPower expects this to increase to more than 35,000 by the end of the year.  Providing revised guidance for the rest of the year, the company said it expects a net loss of $41 million to $46 million or a loss per share of 65 cents to 73 cents for the fourth quarter. The full year net loss is estimated to be between $210 million and $215 million, or $3.55 to $3.63 per share.  Analysts' estimates of the year per share loss range from $3.68 to $3.74, resulting in a consensus per share loss projection of $3.71.  NewPower said it projects the year-end customer count will be between 840,000 and 860,000, of which the fourth-quarter increase is expected to be achieved entirely through marketing.  It said the revised forecast reflects a reduction in the number of customers the company expects to acquire through portfolio acquisitions and the impact of delays in switching Texas customers to NewPower, partly offset by the company's modified marketing strategies and continued cost reductions.  NewPower shares reached a high of $1.25 in Thursday afternoon trading and were still up 48.15 percent, or 39 cents, at $1.20 in the final half hour of trading.  The company is 44 percent owned by Enron Corp. , NewPower's largest provider of electricity and natural gas.    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	  Enron Investors Still Perplexed - And Stock Shows It By Christina Cheddar Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  11/08/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Even as more facts are revealed regarding Enron Corp.'s (ENE) financial dealings, investors can agree: Things remain as clear as mud.  Earlier Thursday, Enron and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) confirmed the neighboring rivals were talks for a potential "business combination." An agreement hasn't been reached yet, and neither company will make any further comment until a contract is signed or the talks end. Separately, Enron restated its earnings from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001.  As the news hit the tape, Enron shares, after being briefly halted, seemed to hunt for a direction. The stock traded as high as $10, and as low as $8.40. Currently, the shares were at $8.67, down 38 cents, or 4.2%. Wednesday, the shares zigzagged.  Meanwhile, Dynegy shares, which had fallen Wednesday as news of the talks began to leak out, regained lost ground and then added some. Dynegy shares were recently trading up $4.54, or 13.8%, at $37.54.  "There's a lot of news to digest," said Glen Hilton, a portfolio manager at San Francisco-based Montgomery Asset Management.  Enron shares have been in a downward spiral since it revealed last month that the unwinding of off-balance sheet transaction with a partnership run by its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, had resulted in the loss of $1.2 billion in shareholder equity.  That bad news led to more bad news, including the downgrades of its credit ratings, which are essential to the health of its core wholesale energy marketing and trading business. Meanwhile, investor confidence eroded as market watchers asked Enron to come clean.  The move in Enron and Dynegy shares Thursday was unusual for companies considering a merger. Typically, shares of the acquirer will fall, while shares of the target climb.  Investors explained the move several ways.  Some said it was a reflection of the lack of a premium Enron shareholders will be paid. Their views were based on a report in The Wall Street Journal, which cited a source familiar with the matter who said Dynegy is considering paying $7 billion to $8 billion in stock, or about one-tenth of what Enron was worth 15 months ago.  Others agreed, and said given recent events they're being cautious.  Larry Alberts, a buy-side analyst at American Express Financial Advisors, said he was questioning how serious Dynegy is about the transaction. He also said there is still the possibility of more bad news to come from Enron.   As for the restatement of earnings going back to 1997, investors said it was clearly having a negative impact on Enron's stock even though some had been expecting it.  John Waterman, of Rittenhouse Financial Services, said the information Enron disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission was "hard to sort through."  Waterman said he was encouraged that the restatement didn't reflect any revenue recognition issues, and it still showed that there was growth in the business - albeit not as much as previously reported.  Enron had to restate the earnings because it should have included three of its off-balance sheet financing vehicles - Chewco Investments LP, Joint Energy Development Investments LP, or JEDI, and a unit of LJM Cayman LP - in its consolidated financial statements under the guidelines of generally accepted accounting principles.  Revelations about the involvement of Enron's Fastow in LJM are at the center of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and led to demands from the financial community that he be terminated.  On Wednesday, Enron disclosed it has fired its treasurer, Ben Glisan, and its general counsel, Kristina Mordaunt, as well.  Gilsan, Mordaunt, and two former Enron employees were partners of LJM while serving at Enron.  Enron continues to say it had controls in place relating to Fastow's involvement with the partnerships. The board required review and approval of each transaction by the office of the chairman, the chief accounting officer and the chief risk officer. Whether these controls and procedures were followed will be investigated by a special committee Enron has named.  Many expect that if Enron remains independent, more executive departures could be in store.  "The bottom line from my perspective is that Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, and the board seemed to be aware (of Fastow's dealings with the LJM partnerships)," said Andre Meade, an analyst at Commerzebanc Securities. "Everyone's hands are dirty, including Ken Lay. ... The firing the CFO and treasurer are not going to single-handedly solve the problems at Enron," he continued.  Others also are questioning the role of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditor.  "People like us have to rely on people like them," said Rittenhouse's Waterman.   According to its restated financial information, Enron had close to $13 billion in debt at Sept. 30.  Liquidity issues remain the chief concern among investors, who continue to fret that the latest disclosure will result in a further deterioration of Enron's credit rating.  "The clock is ticking on Enron," said Montgomery's Hilton. "Each day brings a new piece of incremental news."  Following the release of Enron's earnings last month, Hilton had a hunch the company would likely write off additional investments as it had in the third quarter. However, he was committed to the stock, and at the time he didn't plan to sell his stake, which accounted for 2% of the close to $100 million in assets he manages.  Since that time, Hilton has sold his Enron stock. He said he began selling after news of the SEC probe broke.  "It just got too scary to hold," he said.  Still, Hilton, who owns shares of Dynegy as well, isn't concerned about the possibility of a merger of the two Houston energy traders.  "It's David taking Goliath," he said, adding that he is convinced that Dynegy's management will not enter into a transaction that will threaten the company's stability.  Several Dynegy investors echoed Hilton's sentiment with their own expressions of confidence in Dynegy's management. However, at times these convictions were almost betrayed by a nervousness brought on by the sense that what one doesn't know could be hurtful.  Some investors remain concerned by Dynegy's motivation.  According to Hilton, investors don't know what would happen to the market - and as a result, to Dynegy - if Enron fails.  So, what reason truly is motivating Dynegy?  "It's probably both," Hilton speculated.  -By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.com    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Utility holding company FirstEnergy Corp. sold $4 billion of five-, 10-and 30-year debt on Thursday, helped by investors' preference for defensive sectors as the U.S. economy stalls.  FirstEnergy was able to lower its borrowing costs, trimming yields from initial indications. The sale originally was expected to offer generous yields as heavy bond issuance, weak wholesale power prices and investor jitters over the troubles of energy trading firm Enron Corp. weighed on the utility sector. Akron, Ohio-based FirstEnergy will use proceeds for corporate purposes and to help pay for its recent purchase of Morristown, New Jersey-based GPU Inc. . FirstEnergy purchased GPU for about $4.5 billion in cash and stock, plus the assumption of about $7.2 billion in debt. The sale closed on Tuesday.  Utility bonds are typically viewed as a conservative investments because of the industry's stable income during uncertain economic times. The sector has been under a cloud, though, as Houston-based Enron has struggled with a cash squeeze and writedowns from off-balance-sheet transactions.  "Enron was held up as a model, growing extremely quickly, and the recent financial disclosures are just a shock," said Kelly Perl, a project director at New York utility consulting firm Applied Economic Research.  Spreads, or the yield gaps between utility bonds and U.S. Treasuries, have widened about 0.15 to 0.20 percentage point over the past two weeks, while spreads on gas and pipeline companies have widened about 0.30 percentage points, strategists said.  SALE TERMS  FirstEnergy sold $1 billion of 5.5 percent five-year notes at 99.888 cents on the dollar, yielding 5.526 percent or 1.98 percentage points more than similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries. It also sold $1.5 billion of 6.45 percent 10-year notes at 99.651 cents on the dollar, yielding 6.498 percent or 2.25 percentage points more than Treasuries, and $1.5 billion of 7.375 percent 30-year bonds, yielding 7.389 percent or 2.45 percentage points more than the old long Treasury bond.  Initial price guidance had called for spreads as high as 2.20, 2.35 and 2.60 percentage points more than Treasuries for the five-, 10-and 30-year debt.  FirstEnergy's sale was helped by a 0.50 percentage point interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday and signs that the Fed could cut rates again.  "There is the perception that the Fed is going to aggressively ease and err on the side of caution," said Peter Palfrey, portfolio manager for Loomis Sayles & Co. in Boston. Investors are betting that the Fed will engineer an economic recovery, helping corporate profits and spurring price gains in corporate bonds, Palfrey said.  Analysts said FirstEnergy's acquisition of GPU should benefit its credit quality.  "It adds further diversity to their cash flow from regulated distribution companies," said Fitch analyst Robert Hornick.  Falling wholesale power prices also should benefit FirstEnergy, Hornick said.  "They're not a big seller of wholesale energy at this point," Hornick said. "They don't own generation facilities and need to buy (electricity) in the market, so to the extent wholesale prices are lower, they can benefit," he said.  Standard & Poor's rates FirstEnergy's senior unsecured notes "BBB-minus," its lowest investment grade. Moody's Investors Service rates FirstEnergy's long-term debt "Baa2," roughly one notch higher, while Fitch rates them "BBB."  Salomon Smith Barney, Barclays Capital and Morgan Stanley arranged the sale.    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	  USA: WRAPUP 1-Enron, Dynegy confirm possible merger talks. By Jeff Franks  11/08/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. HOUSTON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., plagued by investor doubts and under the gun to shore up its crumbling finances, said on Thursday it was talking with power trading rival Dynegy Inc. about a possible merger.  The company, whose stock and credit ratings have plummeted amid an uproar about questionable business transactions, admitted it made bookkeeping errors and restated earnings for the last four years. It also said former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who abruptly left the company last month, had made $30 million managing partnerships linked to the deals. The deals, which were off the balance sheet, are now under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for possible conflict of interest.  Two other executives, managing director and treasurer Ben Glisan and Enron division general counsel Kristina Mordaunt, were both believed to have links to the Fastow-led partnerships and have been fired, the company disclosed.  The announcements threw a spotlight on Enron's stark situation, in which the nation's top energy trader has gone from Wall Street darling to pariah in a few weeks and now faces a cash crunch so dire it is seeking a merger with the much-smaller Dynegy.  Its credit ratings have fallen to near-junk levels in recent weeks, making it difficult to get money to boost investor confidence and back the trading operations that provide 90 percent of Enron's income. The company reportedly has been seeking investors to provide a cash infusion for an equity stake.  MODERATE PREMIUM  Word about a possible Dynegy-Enron deal leaked out on Wednesday, and on Thursday the two companies confirmed talks about a possible "business combination" were underway, but said no agreement had been reached.  Sources told Reuters that the two Texas rivals, whose headquarters are a few blocks apart in downtown Houston, were talking about a stock swap with a moderate premium for shareholders and a $1.5 billion capital infusion from ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26.5 percent of Dynegy.  The stock swap is valued at about $8 billion, or about $10 a share, The New York Times reported on Thursday.  A merger would catapult Dynegy to the top of the energy trading industry now dominated by Enron. Last year, the company had $29 billion in revenues, compared to $100 billion for Enron.  For Enron, it would cap an astonishingly rapid fall from grace.  Enron stock has lost $19 billion in market value since its crisis began in mid-October and was down another 45 cents to $8.60 in Thursday trading. Dynegy shares rose $3.87 to $36.87.  Enron restated its earnings going back to 1997, saying its auditors advised that the off-the-balance sheet deals in question should have been included in the company's financial statements.  The restated results reduced Enron's net income by $591 million, or 22 percent, from 1997 to 2000, and increased its debt by $628 million, or 6 percent, after two of the partnership's financial statements were consolidated into Enron's earnings.  Enron said the restatement reflects a $1.2 billion reduction to shareholders' equity that touched off the current controversy when the company offhandedly disclosed it last month. Angry shareholders suddenly worried that Enron was hiding other liabilities in its complex financial statements and began demanding more information.  In a statement, Enron chief executive Ken Lay said the company hoped it had allayed Wall Street fears with Thursday's announcements.  "We believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about these matters," he said.  Analysts, wary after last month's surprise revelations, said Enron may have more to release, but they were pleased it was finally coming forth with information.

A Dow Jones Newswires Column   NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- So Enron Corp. (ENE) says it wants to be more transparent - to make its impenetrable financial results and corporate structure easier for investors and analysts to understand. Based on its announcements Thursday, however, it still has a heck of a long way to go.  With Enron's restatement Thursday of nearly five years' worth of earnings and additional information about the maze of off-balance-sheet deals related to it, we now have a lot more information about the mess at Enron than we had 24 hours ago. But we're not much closer to understanding just what HAPPENED to leave Enron in such a mess - and that's because the company's explanations of all this continue to be dense, confusing and next to impossible to grasp.  Try this tidbit, from the Form 8-K Enron filed about the restatements Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission:  "In addition, Enron's net income is reduced for specific JEDI revenues previously allocated to Chewco, relating to the appreciation in value of Enron stock, which eliminate upon consolidation. This, in effect, reduces Enron's share of JEDI's earnings."  Huh? And no, it doesn't help you to know that "Chewco" is an entity that wasn't included in Enron's financial results but which Enron now admits should have been. Or that "JEDI" isn't a "Star Wars" reference but a limited partnership in which both Enron and Chewco had invested. It's still impenetrable.  Then there are the times when Enron just plain doesn't give enough information. The company says its decision that Chewco should be included in its results after all "is based on current information that Chewco did not meet the accounting criteria to qualify as ... unconsolidated..." Uh - okay. WHY didn't it meet the criteria, and why did Enron previously believe that it did? Enron doesn't say.  Finally, Enron makes some assertions that just make you scratch your head. The company says part of the restatement of its earnings stems from unspecified "prior-year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications which were determined to be immaterial in the year originally proposed."  Hmmm. Beyond the fact that Enron doesn't elaborate on the nature of these "audit adjustments and reclassifications," or why they were originally considered immaterial, consider that according to Enron's own figures in the 8-K, they add up to a negative earnings impact of $87 million since 1997. That amount doesn't sound like any definition of "immaterial" I've ever heard.  An Enron spokesman couldn't immediately be reached for comment.  In fairness, this lack of clarity may be all but inevitable given Enron's Byzantine structure, which involves dealings with outside but related entities that also have third parties involved, which in one case have a subsidiary that allowed Enron to hedge the risks of an investment, and in another case is selling assets purchased from Enron to OTHER entities in order to finish paying Enron for the original transaction, and ... you get the idea. It's next to impossible to make clear because Enron's structure is just too baroque to understand in the first place.  The market is plenty puzzled by all this, even in the wake of Enron's attempt to clarify things. Take a look at the company's drunken-sailor stock chart from Thursday. After news of the restatements hit, Enron stock first jumped higher, going as high as $10 a share, then soon dropped back, to as low as $8.40, as investors started to digest the details of the news. Then up again to about $9.25, then down again to its current level of around $8.50.  There's no reason investors should be confused like this. There is absolutely no reason that a reasonably intelligent layman, with an elementary working knowledge of corporate finance, should be unable to understand the regulatory filings, structure, earnings and balance sheet of any public company.  If that happens, it's the company's fault, not the investor's - either because the company hasn't explained things well enough or because its structure is needlessly complicated to begin with. If Enron wants to get back the market's confidence, fixing that problem, one way or the other, would be a good place to start.  -By Michael Rapoport, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5976; michael.rapoport@dowjones.com    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

RPT Dynergy sharply higher, Enron lower on merger talks  11/08/2001 AFX News (c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd (Repeating to show in headline, lead that Enron is trading lower)  NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Dynergy Inc were sharply higher, while Enron Corp lost ground in midsession trading after the two companies confirmed that they are holding merger talks. At 12.25 pm, Dynergy was up 3.17 usd, or 9.6 pct, at 36.17, Enron fell 0.34 usd, or 3.7 pct, to 8.71 usd and ChevronTexaco dropped 0.18 usd to 87.10. The DJIA was up 110.22 points at 9,664.59, the S&P 500 index gained 12.88 points to 1,128.68 and the Nasdaq composite rose 34.35 points to 1,871.88.  Enron share price today was hurt after the company announced a restatement of its net income from 1997 to the third quarter of 2001. The revisions were, for the most part, reductions in the bottom-line figure.  The 8 bln usd tie-up talks, which come at a time when Enron is being investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the markets are losing faith in the energy trader, are seen as particularly positive for Dynergy.  Analysts see a tie-up as highly accretive for Dynergy, which is 26 pct owned by ChevronTexaco, with many synergies also possible.  Banc of America analyst William Maze, who rates Dynergy 'Strong Buy', said: "If this transaction comes to fruition, we would be aggressive buyers of Dynergy given its accretive nature as well as the lifting of Enron's credibility issues that has been plaguing the entire industry."  CIBC World Markets analyst William Hyler, who rates Enron 'Buy', added: "The move would also catapult (Dynergy) into a leadership role at what could prove near the bottom of the gas/power pricing cycle."  On the other hand, Enron's position would improve as its credibility within the trading world and in the face of its trading counterparties would recover somewhat.  To that end, Dynergy would provide a yet unspecified cash injection, believed to be approximately 1.5-2.0 bln usd, to improve Enron's standing and shore up its finances.  ChevronTexaco, which is expected to provide a substantial part of the financing needed for the merger, also stands to gain from the situation as it would retain effective control of the combined company.  rdc/lj  For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Coal prices slumped in physical markets last week, as mild weather in the East, a slowing economy and high utility inventories undercut demand, sources said Wednesday.  Over-the-counter prices for Central Appalachian barges for calendar year 2002 slid $1.75 from last week to $32.00 a ton on Tuesday, trading several times at that level, people in the market said. With major coal producers sold out for the remainder of this year and most of next year, traders said, prices could move higher if there were a sudden rise in demand.  "Utilities are comfortable in their stockpiles, a trader said. "The only thing that would make this market bounce a little bit would be some cold weather in the East."  The cut in Enron Corp's (ENE) credit rating and a Security and Exchange Commission investigation into its transactions with off-balance-sheet partnerships was making the energy giant's coal customers anxious about getting paid, people in the market said. A coal broker said counterparties were watching Enron's credit and limiting longer-term business with the company.  "Everyone is nervous," a buyer at a Midwestern utility said.  Major coal producers and coal-burning utilities interviewed by Dow Jones Newswires on Wednesday said they hadn't suspended trading with Enron.  Physical prices were largely unaffected by the turmoil in the trading business and continued the downward trend that began in mid-October.  In the East, where prices softened in light trade, Central Appalachian barge deals for November delivery to the Big Sandy River were done in late October as low as $30.75 free on board, down from $33.50 a ton. December and the first quarter of 2002 traded several times Tuesday at $32.00 and $32.25 a ton, down $1.50 since late October.  Rail deliveries were pegged between $36.00 and $38.00 a ton FOB. No deals were confirmed.  In the West, Powder River Basin coal with a heat rate of 8,800 British thermal units slipped to $7.55 a ton for November, down a nickel since late October. Deals for calendar year 2002 were done at $8.10 and $8.15 a ton, down about 10 cents.  PRB 8,400 Btu coal traded very little, sources said. November deliveries deals were done at $5.90 a ton, down from $6.25 a ton at the end of October. Calendar year 2002 was pegged between $6.35 and $6.45 a ton, down 10 cents.  According to the Energy Information Agency, total U.S. coal production through Oct. 27, the latest date for which figures were available, ticked upward by 445,000 short tons to 21.8 million tons.  Appalachian coal production, year to date, was 2% ahead of last year. Total Appalachian production in 2001 is 356,557 tons, up from 349,711 tons in the same period last year.  U.S. Western coal production year to date remains steady at 6.4% ahead of 2000 figures. EIA reports total western coal production through Oct. 27 at 447,308 tons, up from 420,353 tons in the year-earlier period.  Railcar loadings through the end of October were 5% higher than comparable 2000 figures, according the EIA.  Activity on the New York Mercantile Exchange, which came to virtual standstill last week, picked up on Tuesday. On Tuesday, open interest for the December coal contract was at 217. The December contract, which expires Nov. 27, settled Tuesday at $31.75 a ton, down $2 from Oct. 30.

All Rights Reserved. 	  UK: Rivals eye Enron's metals trading business. By Andy Blamey  11/08/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - U.S. energy trading giant Enron Corp. , whose shares have tumbled amid a regulatory probe and doubts about its ability to raise cash, may lose or offload its metals business, senior industry sources said on Thursday.  In the wings are several interested parties looking to snap up the company's metals customer base. "There are people out there with the experience and the contacts who see this time as a good opportunity to get into the market," a senior metals market source told Reuters on Thursday.  Such a move for Enron's metals portfolio would involve the acquisition of an existing organisation as a vehicle, the source added.  "We do not comment on rumours," an Enron spokeswoman said, declining further comment.  Other Enron Metals assets were also said to be in play, including the Henry Bath warehousing company, which operates LME-registered warehouses in the UK, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United States.  MAJOR PLAYER  Houston-based Enron became a major player in the metals trade in May last year when it acquired MG plc, a leading independent international metals dealing firm in London, in a deal worth around 300 million pounds.  The company is a ring-dealing member of the London Metal Exchange (LME), able to participate in open-outcry floor trade, and is active in screen-based metals trade via its EnronOnline platform (www.enrononline.com).  The company no longer has a stake in online metals trading platform EMETRA (www.emetra.com), having sold its holding to other EMETRA shareholders this summer.  But while Enron may be a heavy hitter in the metals sector, base metals trading could hardly be regarded as one of its core businesses.  The company's third-quarter 2001 results statement shows income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) from "Europe and other commodity markets" - which includes metals and steel alongside European gas and power, among others - of $53 million, unchanged from the year-earlier period.  This compares with IBIT from Enron's gas and power market-making operations and merchant energy activities in North and South America of $710 million over the same period.  But the third-quarter figure that has slashed the value of the company's shares is a $1.2 billion write-down of shareholder equity related to off-balance sheet transactions.  On Thursday the company said it would restate its earnings for 1997 to 2001 to reflect the transactions - a move which wipes $613 million of the company's reported net income from 1997 through the first half of this year.  The company's stock has dropped by almost 78 percent since Enron released its earnings results on October 16, falling to nine-year lows amid concerns about the company's ability to raise cash.  The story added an extra twist on Wednesday as news broke that U.S.-based energy trading and marketing firm Dynegy Inc. was in talks to buy out Enron.  Against this background speculation is rife about the future of the metals operation, fuelled by the company's decision last month to trim between 10 and 20 percent of its metals workforce as part of a wider staff reduction by Enron Europe.  UNLIKELY TO REMAIN INTACT  Any decision by Enron or a possible future purchaser to offload its metals operations would be unlikely to see Enron Metals remain intact, traders said.  "They paid $450 million for MG. Would they get $450 million for Enron Metals? I don't think so," said one.  "Why buy the whole concern when you can cherry-pick the best traders and the clients will follow?" added another.  An increasing emphasis on screen trading at the expense of personal contacts may already have persuaded some Enron clients to jump ship.  "We've picked up a fair amount of small and mid-sized trade-type business in Europe from people who've said 'I'm not going to be told just to trade on a screen,'" said one trader.  Another trader said: "A lot of this business revolves around who you've been trading with and talking to over a period of time. It's about individuals," he said.  "Enron Online...should be seen as an 'added value' product, not as the only way of trading. Customers still want to talk to their broker, and are willing to pay commission for the service," the senior source said.  Enron's financial position could also prompt customers to consider other options, the first trader said.  "As a customer, you want to place your business where there's financial stability. If a company isn't financially stable, you'll move elsewhere."  Enron's trade counterparties are also keeping a close eye on the company's financial situation, said a trader at one LME brokerage.  "People aren't particularly concerned about short-term trading (with Enron), but when it comes to OTC business done outside the clearing market they're backing off a bit," he said.

WRAP: Enron To Restate Results; Confirms Dynegy Talks  11/08/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) said it will restate its financial results from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001, as the embattled energy company and Dynegy Inc. both confirmed they are in talks on a possible business combination.  In a filing Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Enron said its financial and audit reports are unreliable for those periods. Enron said that three "unconsolidated entities should have been included in its consolidated financial statements," based on generally accepted accounting principles. These entities are Chewco Investments LP, Joint Energy Development Investments LP and a wholly owned unit of LJM Cayman LP.  Enron said it has established a special committee to review all transactions. The committee will specifically review all "economic results" related to transactions between Enron and LJM.  Last month Enron took a $1.01 billion charge in the third quarter related to write-downs of investments. Of this, $35 million was attributed to partnerships run until recently by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who has since been replaced. Enron also disclosed it shrank shareholder equity by $1.2 billion, as a result of several transactions including ones undertaken with Fastow's investment vehicle.  Later, Enron said the SEC would investigate the company's "related party transactions," including those with the Fastow partnerships.  The restatement will reflect the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholders' equity, as well as various income-statement and balance-sheet adjustments determined by Enron and its auditors.  "We believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about these matters," said Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay  Over the past couple of days, Enron has been scrambling to line up quick financing from a prominent outside investor and has been in discussions with private-equity firms and power-trading companies.  Earlier, The Wall Street Journal reported that Dynegy was trying to buy Enron for $7 billion to $8 billion in stock. Both are Houston-based energy-trading and power companies.  Because any combination of the two would likely be scrutinized for many months, and Enron needs to shore up its finances now, Dynegy reportedly is expected to inject $1.5 billion into Enron immediately, people familiar with the matter said.  ChevronTexaco Corp. (CVX), which owns a 26% stake in Dynegy, is expected to provide Dynegy with the funds for the cash infusion and is playing a significant role in the negotiations, the Journal said.  The boards of Dynegy, Chevron and Enron reportedly met Wednesday to discuss a potential deal. Enron's stock has plunged since Oct. 16, when the company posted a $618 million third-quarter loss and revealed that its shareholder equity had been reduced.  The talks between Enron and Dynegy follow a sharp decline in Enron's stock over the past several weeks.    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	  USA: Enron fires two employees linked to partnerships.  11/08/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. , the embattled energy trader, said on Thursday fired its treasurer and a counsel who the company said were part-owners of one of its off-balance sheet partnerships now under investigation by U.S. regulators.  Enron said it was terminating the employment of Ben Glisan, managing director and treasurer of Enron Corp., and Kristina Mordaunt, a managing director and counsel of an Enron division. Enron said it believes that these two employees, along with four other former Enron employees, were involved as partners in a limited partnership called the LJM1 that had dealings with Enron.

Enron restates net income for periods from 1997 to Q3 2001  11/08/2001 AFX News (c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd HOUSTON (AFX) - Enron Corp announced it is restating its net results for 1997 to 2000 and for the first three quarters of 2001 to take account of various related party and off-balance sheet transactions in which the company was involved.  The restatement have no effect on Enron's current financial position, it said. In its restated figures, Enron posted reductions to net income of 96 mln usd in 1997, 113 mln usd in 1998, 250 mln in 1999 and 132 mln in 2000, as well as increases of 17 mln usd for the first quarter of 2001 and 5 mln for the second, but reduced the third quarter figure by 17 mln usd.  The restatement will have no negative impact on the company's reported earnings for the nine month period ending Sept 2001, however, it said.  The company said its changes to net income are the result of the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments LP and Chewco Investments LP beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of the LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  The JEDI and Chewco consolidations will increase Enron's debt by about 711 mln usd in 1997, 561 mln in 1998, 685 mln in 1999 and 628 mln in 2000, the company said.  kgd/jkm/ For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved. NEW YORK (AP) - Beleaguered energy trading giant Enron Corp. announced Thursday it would restate its earnings since 1997, in part to reflect a controversial dlrs 1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that has sparked a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.  Enron, whose stock price has fallen roughly 80 percent in the past three weeks, also said it was holding talks with Dynegy Inc. relating to some form of business transaction. The New York Times reported that Dynegy was considering buying Enron, its larger hometown rival for dlrs 8 billion. In a filing with the SEC, Enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 "should not be relied upon" and that partnerships run by Enron officials during that period should have been consolidated into the financial results of the Houston-based energy trading giant.  These partnerships are Chewco Investments L.P., Joint Energy Development Investments L.P., and a wholly owned unit of LJM Cayman L.P.  "We believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about these matters," said Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive.  By its own assessment, Enron's restatement reduces previously reported net income by roughly dlrs 586 million and increases its debt by dlrs 2.59 billion. The change reflects the financial impact of retroactively consolidating the partnerships.  The company also fired two executives on Thursday: Ben Glisan, its treasurer, and Kristina Mordaunt, general counsel for one of its divisions. Previously, Enron had ousted chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who was in charge of some of the partnerships.  Shares of Enron were off 10 cents to dlrs 8.95 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Enron said it believes the restatement will include a reduction to net income of about dlrs 96 million in 1997, dlrs 113 million in 1998, dlrs 250 million in 1999 and dlrs 132 million in 2000, increases of dlrs 17 million for the first quarter of 2001 and dlrs 5 million for the second quarter and a reduction of dlrs 17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  Enron, the top buyer and seller of natural gas and the top wholesale marketer in the United States, had become one of the nation's 10 largest companies, recording revenue of dlrs 100.8 billion in 2000.  But the company has been beset by huge investment losses and questions about its financial stability. In particular, its stock has plunged since Oct. 16, when the company posted a dlrs 618 million third quarter loss and revealed that its shareholder equity had been reduced.  Enron's woes have prompted considerable speculation about a possible takeover of the company.  Besides Dynegy, companies mentioned as possible suitors included General Electric's GE Capital unit and Royal Dutch/Shell Group.  On Thursday, both Dynegy and Enron released statements confirming they were in talks, but declined to provide any details.  The New York Times reported earlier that Dynegy is considering paying about dlrs 8 billion in stock, or roughly dlrs 10 per share.  Under the terms of the deal, Enron would receive an immediate dlrs 1.5 billion cash infusion from oil giant Chevron Texaco, which holds a 27 percent stake in Dynegy, the Times said, citing executives close to the discusssion.  Chevron Texaco would provide an additional dlrs 1 billion injection at a later date, the Times reported, while Dynegy would assume dlrs 12.8 billion in Enron debt, plus billions of dollars in other debt that has been kept off the beleaguered company's balance sheet and has been a significant contributor to its current problems.

HOUSTON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. said on Thursday it provided U.S. regulators with more information about off-balance sheet deals, and other transactions that led to a shattering of the company's credibility and to an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Enron, the once high-flying Houston-based energy trading company, also confirmed it was in talks with its hometown rival Dynegy Inc. over a possible business combination. Terms of any deal have not been agreed on, the two companies said. Enron said that it will restate its earnings from 1997 to 2000 and the first two quarters of 2001 as the company addresses concerns raised by the SEC and shareholders.  Shares of Enron dropped 20 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $8.85 in Thursday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Enron, the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in North America, said the required restatement reflects the surprising - and controversial - $1.2 billion reduction to shareholders' equity the company recently disclosed.  The restatement also reflects adjustments to the company's income statement and balance sheet, now that Enron has decided that the financial activities of Chewco Investments, L.P., Joint Energy Development Investments Limited Partnership (JEDI) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of LJM1 should indeed have been included in the company's consolidated financial statements.  As a result of the restatement, Enron is reducing its 1997 net income by about $96 million, 1998 net income by $113 million, 1999 net income by $250 million and 2000 net income by $132 million.  It is also restating first quarter 2001 results with a $17 million net income increase, second quarter 2001 results with a $5 million increase and third quarter 2001 results with a $17 million net income decrease.  Consolidating Chewco and JEDI also increases Enron's debt by about $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.  "We believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about these matters," said Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay in a statement.

Bailout Seen Unlikely By Jason Leopold  11/08/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  (This story initially ran late Wednesday.) LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Maybe Enron Corp. (ENE) is just too big to fail. Maybe not.  Is the embattled energy trading company important enough to qualify for a federal bailout?  Not likely, according to a number of analysts who believe that there are enough big energy companies in the U.S. to keep markets liquid if Enron goes under.  For that reason, a federal bailout is probably not in the cards, even though Enron controls about 25% of U.S. natural gas and electricity markets, they added.  "A bailout would only occur if needed to maintain liquidity in the energy markets in order to avoid potential for skyrocketing prices and avoid reliability risks," said Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER) analyst Steven Fleishman. "In the end, government is most interested in keeping the lights and the heat on at a reasonable price."  Once a Wall Street darling, Enron's stock has fallen about by 75% in a mere three weeks, and the company is now the subject of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.  Because it's so big, energy companies have watched Enron's troubles closely, and speculated about what they could mean for energy markets overall. A number have said they've started to cut back on their exposure to the company.  Enron's stock has been falling all year, but it plunged several weeks ago after it disclosed a $1.2 billion writedown of shareholder equity. The SEC subsequently launched an investigation into Enron partnerships associated with the writedown.  Enron spokesperson Karen Denne said the company wouldn't speculate on the idea of a bailout.  "First of all I can't speculate, and second of all we're not even going to entertain worst case scenarios," Denne said. "As far as I know no one has approached Washington about a federal bailout."  But one source inside Enron said the company isn't ruling out the possibility of approaching Washington if "things get really bad."  A bailout would require federal legislation.  To qualify, Enron would have to argue that a bailout is an economic necessity, according to Christine Uspenski, an analyst at Schwab Capital Markets (SCH). Quite Different Cup Of Tea From Chrysler   Unlike the situation that led to a $1.2 billion federal bailout of Chrysler Corp. in 1980, hundreds of thousands of jobs aren't now at risk. Enron is nowhere near the size of Chrysler.  "When Chrysler was bailed out there were senators and congressman who were going to have unemployed constituents so they proposed federal legislation to give the company a $1.2 billion loan," Uspenski said. "A bailout would need federal legislation proposed by Texas delegation. It would be hard because Enron is not the size of an employer like Chrysler. The one caveat is bailouts happen to be the fashion of the moment. Enron would have to make a compelling case that this is an economic necessity. They would have to quantify the risk to the energy market and there's such bad karma around the energy market right now."  Robert Christensen, an analyst with FAC Equities in New York, agreed.  "I can't even imagine something like that happening," Christensen said. "It's so far-fetched."  A merger, on the other hand, would funnel billions of dollars into Enron, keep the company afloat and might help the company's stock recover, analysts said.  On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Enron is in talks for a capital infusion and possible acquisition by Dynegy Inc. (DYN). Also, Enron said Thursday it will restate its financial statements from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001, saying its financial and audit reports are unreliable for all those periods. The company fired its treasurer and general counsel.  Andrew Meade, an analyst with Commerzbank in New York, said a bailout would likely never materialize because there are other large traders of energy commodities in the marketplace, such as Duke Energy (DUK), Dynegy, Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Williams Cos. (WMB), that can provide liquidity to the market.  A merger would be a better route for the company, but would pose its own set of problems, Meade added.  "With a merger or an equity infusion, Enron can certainly survive," Meade said. "Enron has a lot of nice attributes, it is a great trading and marketing platform and companies are certainly smart to take a look at it. But merging with or buying Enron is not an easy thing to do because of troublesome issues like a federal investigation and a range of assets that would be pretty tough to sell."  Enron's best assets "get up and go home everyday," Meade said, referring to energy traders at the company. If Enron were to get into a friendly merger or buyout, he added, the company should lock in its top 50 or 100 traders with non-compete clauses. It would be much easier for Dynegy or other Houston energy companies to simply hire Enron employees rather than buy the company.  Other analysts also pointed to risks in a merger with Enron.  "A merger is certainly an option, but it gives you pause if it asks you to be the white knight," Uspenski said. A proposed merger could turn out to be a "minefield and there would certainly be a pretty sizable exposure. It would definitely make shareholders nervous."  Gerald Keenan, a partner in PWC Consulting in Chicago, was skeptical about the proposed reports of a merger between Dynegy and Enron.  "Dynegy is not that big a company," Keenan said. "It has a market cap of about $14 billion. What Enron needs is someone to carry it. How is an entity like Dynegy going to carry Enron? Enron has a small market cap but a huge balance sheet."  Keenan also said Enron wouldn't be likely to secure a federal bailout.  "The only caveat would be if the bailout would have some kind of significant effect on energy commodity markets," Keenan said. "Other than that, it's unlikely the federal government will bail Enron out."  -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron Bonds Give Back Gains as Firm Restates Profit (Update3) 2001-11-08 16:40 (New York)  Enron Bonds Give Back Gains as Firm Restates Profit (Update3)       (Updates bond and stock prices.)       New York, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds pared earlier gains as the biggest energy trader said it restated earnings for more than four years, increasing concern that Dynegy Inc. won't buy out the company.       Enron's 7.88 percent coupon notes due in 2003 traded at 77 cents on the dollar to yield 27 percent, down from a bid of 82 cents this morning, traders said. The debt, which was trading near 100 last month, was bid at 77 cents yesterday. Enron shares, down 75 percent in the last month, fell 64 cents to $8.41 today.       Dynegy said today it's in talks to acquire Enron in what people familiar with the situation said would likely be a stock transaction worth $8 billion. An acquisition would bolster Enron's credit rating, which was recently lowered, traders said.       ``Enron bonds justifiably rallied on the good news of Dynegy. They naturally settled back down as the market assesses the significance of the restatement,'' said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst at CreditSights Inc. ``The whole problem goes away and sighs of relief all around if they come to terms with Dynegy.''       Enron's 6.4 percent notes due in 2006 were bid at around 70 cents, down from this morning when the debt traded at 84 cents. Yesterday, the notes were priced between 72 cents and 74 cents.       The difference between bid and ask prices for Enron debt widened to about 4 cents to 5 cents -- ``monster'' spreads, Reynolds said -- from 2 cents this morning, indicating few investors are willing to buy or sell the bonds without more news.       While Moody's Investors Service rates Enron's credit as ``Baa2'', one rung higher than its ``Baa3'' grade for Dynegy, other ratings companies including Standard & Poor's and Fitch Inc. have assigned Dynegy a higher rating. Also, Enron's ratings have been cut in recent weeks and face further reduction, while Dynegy's credit outlook is stable.       Enron bonds and shares have tumbled in recent weeks on concern about partnerships run by the company's former chief financial officer and concerns the company's trading business will be hurt by the credit downgrades. Enron and Dynegy are both based in Houston.       Enron has $15.8 billion of bonds outstanding, more than double the $6.8 billion market value of its stock, according to Bloomberg data.    Apache to Cut 2002 Drilling Budget 70% on Gas Prices (Update1) 2001-11-08 16:34 (New York)  Apache to Cut 2002 Drilling Budget 70% on Gas Prices (Update1)       (Updates with closing share price in fifth paragraph and closing Nymex gas price in last paragraph.)       Houston, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Apache Corp., an oil and natural-gas producer, plans to cut spending on drilling next year by 70 percent, blaming wide swings in gas prices caused by traders such as Enron Corp. and Dynegy Inc.       The company will trim spending to $300 million from $1 billion this year, Chief Executive Officer Raymond Plank said in an interview. Gas on the New York Mercantile Exchange reached $10.10 per million British thermal units in late December and touched $1.76 per million British thermal units in September.       The market for gas derivatives is 15 times the cash market for delivery to customers, and broad price changes make it difficult for oil and gas companies to set budgets, Plank said.       ``You've got a 150-pound tail wagging a 10-pound dog,'' Plank said. ``You can't predict what your cash flow may be. Therefore, your budgeting is difficult.''       Shares of Apache were unchanged at $50.73. They have fallen 28 percent this year. Apache, Dynegy and Enron, the biggest energy trader, are based in Houston.       ``We can always go back and take another look at (spending) later,'' Apache spokesman Tony Lentini said. ``We look at our (budget) regularly, and we're known for moving pretty quickly.''       Enron, whose plunging stock price forced it to begin merger talks with rival Dynegy, today restated earnings for more than four years because of losses from partnerships under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.       Fearing an Enron collapse might cripple the gas-derivatives market, Apache said yesterday it traded out of most of its gas hedges, making $70 million so far.       ``Apache is trying to conserve cash and retain the maximum amount of flexibility,'' said Irene Haas, an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris Inc. ``Apache has been traditionally very nimble in responding to these cycles. There's something to be said for being cautious and conservative when the visibility is bad.''       Haas rates Apache ``accumulate'' and doesn't own its shares.       Nymex gas has averaged $2.7 per million British thermal units so far this quarter, down almost half from the same time a year earlier. It rose 9 cents to $2.96 per million British thermal units today.    Enron Fires Treasurer, Alleges Improper Investment (Update2) 2001-11-08 16:31 (New York)  Enron Fires Treasurer, Alleges Improper Investment (Update2)       (Updates with closing share prices in ninth paragraph and information on board approval starting in 17th paragraph.)       Houston, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which today reduced its earnings for the last four years by $552 million because of accounting errors involving affiliates, also said it fired its treasurer and a corporate attorney for making improper investments in one of the affiliates.       Enron fired Treasurer Ben Glisan and Kristina Mordaunt, the general counsel of an unspecified Enron division. The two invested in an affiliate created by Enron to buy and sell the company's assets, the Houston-based company said in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.       The transactions also involved two former Enron employees and former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who was replaced two weeks ago, the filing said. The former employees were Kathy Lynn, vice president of an unnamed Enron division, and Anne Yaeger, identified by Enron as a non-officer employee.       Lea Fastow, Andrew Fastow's wife, referred all questions to her husband's attorney, who couldn't immediately be reached for comment. Glisan wouldn't comment. Attempts to reach Mordaunt weren't successful.                          $30 Million Profit       Fastow made more than $30 million by managing and investing in two private limited partnerships called LJM Cayman LP, known as LJM1, and LJM2 Co-Investment LP. Enron said on Oct. 24 that Fastow had been replaced as CFO and put on leave. The filing said he is no longer with the company.       Enron said it believes Lynn and Yaeger remain associated with LJM2.       The SEC began a formal investigation into some of Enron's partnerships last month, causing the stock price to plummet from already low levels. Shares of Enron had fallen 89 percent this year, as of the close of trading yesterday.       Enron, short on cash, began merger talks with Dynegy Inc. Yesterday, it failed to reach an agreement with Dynegy to sell itself for about $8 billion in stock. ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 27 percent of Dynegy, is also involved in the talks. Dynegy is concerned credit rating companies may downgrade Enron's debt, people familiar with the situation said.       Enron shares fell 64 cents, or 7.1 percent, $8.41. Shares of Dynegy, which is also based in Houston, rose $3.50, or 11 percent, to $36.50. ChevronTexaco rose 31 cents to $87.59.                              Restatement       Enron restated its earnings for the past four years and the first three quarters of 2001 to incorporate the first LJM partnership, as well as Chewco Investments LP and Joint Energy Development Investments LP, known as JEDI.       Enron calls them special purpose entities, or SPEs. They are vehicles for getting access to capital or hedging risk that can be moved off the books under some circumstances. Enron established more than 30 SPEs.       The company reported that Enron and ``Enron-related entities'' participated in 24 ``business relationships'' in which LJM1 or LJM2 participated. They included the sale of asset such as unused fiber optic cable, the purchase of debt or equity interests in Enron affiliates, and the sale by LJM2 of a call and a put option on some assets.      In addition to Chewco and JEDI, a wholly owned subsidiary of LMJ1 that ``engaged in derivative transactions with Enron to permit Enron to hedge market risks of an equity investment in Rhythms NetConnections, Inc.,'' which provides high-speed networking to businesses.       Enron said in the SEC filing that those hedging transactions should have been consolidated into its 1999 and 2000 results because the LJM1 subsidiary was inadequately capitalized. Enron did not specify why transactions by Chewco and JEDI should have been included on its balance sheet.       Enron said it believes that Michael J. Kopper, a former company employee, managed a Chewco general partner and invested in it. The company said it also believes that Kopper was the controlling partner of a limited partnership that (through another limited partnership) in March 2000 purchased interests in affiliated subsidiaries of LJM1.''       The company said that it believes the limited partners in that deal also included Glisan, Mordaunt, Lynn and Yaeger. An ``entity associated with'' Fastow was also a limited partner, Enron said.       Enron said that its board approved Fastow's initial transaction with LJM1 and put controls in place that required the review and approval of each transaction by the office of the chairman, the chief accounting officer and the chief risk officer.      Lay and Skilling were for many years the only members of the office of the chairman. After Skilling's resignation in August, Enron promoted Greg Whalley to president and chief operating officer and Mark Frevert to vice chairman. Both became members of the office of the chairman.       Lay, as chairman, also had the authority to require Fastow to resign from the partnerships at any time. The board also directed that its Audit and Compliance Committee conduct annual reviews of transactions between Enron and LJM1 and LJM2 completed during the previous year, the filing said.    Dynegy Rises on Optimism It May Get Enron for Bargain (Update2) 2001-11-08 16:28 (New York)  Dynegy Rises on Optimism It May Get Enron for Bargain (Update2)       (Updates with closing share prices.)       Houston, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. shares rose 11 percent on speculation that the company may be able to buy Enron Corp., the biggest energy trader, at a bargain price.       Dynegy said today it's in talks to buy Enron. Dynegy, a rival Houston-based energy trader, is considering an acquisition of Enron for stock valued at almost $8 billion, people familiar with the situation said. With 850 million shares outstanding, Enron has a market value of about $7.7 billion.       Enron was forced to consider a sale after its stock plunged this year and its credit ratings were cut amid a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into partnerships run by a former executive. Enron shares yesterday touched $7 a share, their lowest level in more than a decade. A year ago, the stock traded at more than $80 a share.       ``If Dynegy can get Enron for $10 or $11 a share, it's a heck of a good deal,'' said Sanders Morris Harris analyst John Olson, who owns Enron shares. ``That's why the shares are up.''      Dynegy rose $3.50 a share to $36.50. Enron fell 64 cents, or 7.1 percent, to $8.41.       Enron failed yesterday to reach an agreement with Dynegy, which is concerned that credit-rating agencies may reduce Enron's debt to junk status, people familiar with the situation said. Enron today restated earnings for more than four years to include losses from investment partnerships.       ``The lack of (Enron) investor confidence at this point makes it likely that Dynegy could buy Enron and pay little or no premium,'' said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade. Dynegy ``is unlikely to pay significantly more than Enron's current share price if it does make a bid,'' he said.       An acquisition of Enron would make Dynegy the biggest energy trader, eliminating its largest rival, analysts said. Dynegy also would get the leading energy manager for commercial and small- industrial customers, and an Internet energy-trading operation many times larger than its own, analysts said.       ``People are betting for or against a deal with Enron,'' said Meade, who rates Enron shares ``accumulate'' and doesn't own them.    NewPower 3rd-Qtr Loss Narrows After Adding Customers (Update4) 2001-11-08 16:08 (New York)  NewPower 3rd-Qtr Loss Narrows After Adding Customers (Update4)       (Updates with closing share price in sixth paragraph. Updates Enron's share decline in fifth paragraph.)       Purchase, New York, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- NewPower Holdings Inc., a venture formed by Enron Corp. to compete with traditional gas and electric utilities, said its third-quarter loss narrowed after cutting costs and adding customers.       The loss was $67.1 million, or $1.15 a share, compared with a loss of $69.9 million, or $2.96, a year earlier. Revenue tripled to $54.7 million from $18.2 million, the company said. NewPower was forecast to have a loss of $1.16 a share, the average estimate of three analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.       NewPower added 80,000 customers in the third quarter and expects to have 840,000 to 860,000 customers by the end of the year. The company, based in Purchase, New York, reduced sales, general and administrative costs by 41 percent, primarily by cutting systems-development and professional expenses.       The company is eliminating 40 jobs, or 22 percent of its workforce, to cut costs, Chief Financial Officer William Jacobs said on a conference call. NewPower expects costs of $16 million in the fourth quarter for severance and to end a business alliance with AOL Time Warner Inc., spokeswoman Gael Doar said.       Enron, the largest energy trader, owns about 44 percent of NewPower. Houston-based Enron, whose shares have fallen 75 percent since Oct. 16 amid concern over affiliated partnerships run by its former chief financial officer, said it had $544 million in losses on investments including NewPower in the third quarter.       Shares of NewPower rose 42 cents to $1.23. The company first sold shares to the public in October 2000 for $21 a share. The offering increased the number of shares outstanding to about 58 million from 23 million.                                Fourth Quarter       Excluding costs for severance and to end the AOL agreement, NewPower expects a fourth-quarter loss of $41 million to $46 million, or 65 cents to 73 cents a share, and a full-year loss of $210 million to $215 million, or $3.55 to $3.63.       The company was expected to lose 74 cents in the fourth quarter, according to First Call's average of three analysts' estimates. The full-year's loss was expected to be $3.71, the average of four analysts' estimates.       In 2002, NewPower expects to have a loss of $100 million to $125 million, or $1.59 to $1.99 a share. The average estimate of four analysts polled by First Call was $2.26.       NewPower expects to be profitable in 2003 with 1.5 million customers. The company is focusing more on small businesses. It now has 25,000 small-business customers and expects to have more than 35,000 by the end of the year.       International Business Machines Corp. owns 1.5 million shares of NewPower, less than 5 percent of the company.    Enron Restates Years of Profits, in Talks With Dynegy (Update4) 2001-11-08 15:41 (New York)  Enron Restates Years of Profits, in Talks With Dynegy (Update4)       (Adds Dynegy share price in sixth paragraph.)       Houston, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which began merger talks with Dynegy Inc. after its stock plunged, restated earnings for more than four years to include losses from investment partnerships arranged by senior executives.       The largest energy trader failed yesterday to reach an agreement with Dynegy to sell itself for about $8 billion in stock. Dynegy is concerned credit rating companies may downgrade Enron's debt, people familiar with the situation said. A reduction to junk status would precipitate a cash crisis by requiring Enron to repay early $3.3 billion of bonds.       ``Restating earnings for the past five years is suggestive of fraud, which in itself is justification for a downgrade,'' said Donald Coxe, who manages 78,000 Enron shares as part of the Harris Insight Equity Fund. ``I'd be surprised if they're not downgraded.''       The decision by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay to reduce earnings by $586 million since 1997 is part of Enron's efforts to regain confidence among investors stung by the 89 percent plunge in the stock this year and a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into how the company accounted for partnerships it sponsored.       Enron fired Treasurer Ben Glisan and Kristina Mourdant, a lawyer for an Enron division. The company ``now believes'' Glisan, Mourdant and two other employees no longer working for Enron bought interests in subsidiaries of a partnership run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.       Dynegy's shares rose as much as 14 percent on speculation that it may decide not to buy cash-strapped Enron, or, if it did, wouldn't pay much of a premium.       ``People are betting for or against a deal with Enron,'' said Andre Meade, an analyst with Commerzbank AG who rates Enron ``accumulate.'' Dynegy ``is unlikely to pay significantly more than Enron's current share price if it does make a bid,'' he said.                          Shares Decline       Enron shares declined 40 cents to $8.65 after the company determined it violated generally accepted accounting rules when it failed to consolidate results for three so-called special purpose entities, vehicles for getting access to capital or hedging risk that can be moved off the books under some circumstances.       Enron ousted Fastow last month after revealing an accounting error for transactions with a group of the partnerships resulted in a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in the third quarter. Arthur Andersen LLP was Enron's independent auditor.       The company today reduced 1997 net income by $96 million, 1998 earnings by $113 million, 1999 results by $250 million, and 2000 earnings by $132 million. In 2001, the changes resulted in an increase to net income of $17 million in the first quarter and $5 million in the second quarter, and a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter.       Enron bonds pared gains after the earnings were restated, as the threat of a credit downgrade dimmed a rally sparked by the Dynegy talks. Enron's debt doubled in the past four years to $13 billion at the end of the third quarter. Both Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service are considering lowering their ratings, which are two levels above junk.       ``Enron is running out of time and that's what's pushing them to the bargaining table,'' said Zach Wagner, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co., who cut his recommendation on Enron to ``reduce'' from ``accumulate'' on Oct. 23.       Securities regulators are investigating Enron's web of more than 30 partnerships, including two in which Fastow served as general partner: LJM Cayman LP, known as LJM1, and LJM2 Co- Investment LP, known as LJM2. Fastow received more than $30 million from LJM investments and management fees, Enron said.                            Labyrinth       The company reported that Enron and ``Enron-related entities'' participated in 24 ``business relationships'' in which LJM1 or LJM2 participated. They included the sale of assets, such as unused fiber optic cable, the purchase of debt or equity interests in Enron affiliates, and the sale by LJM2 of a call and a put option on assets.       The partnerships involved in the restatement are Chewco Investments LP; Joint Energy Development Investments, known as JEDI; and a wholly owned subsidiary of LJM1 that ``engaged in derivative transactions with Enron to permit Enron to hedge market risks of an equity investment in Rhythms NetConnections Inc.,'' which provides high-speed networking to businesses.       Some companies that trade natural gas, electricity and other commodities with Enron may pull back if Enron's finances deteriorate to the point that it loses its investment-grade credit rating, investors say.       Atlanta-based Mirant Corp., a top U.S. energy trader, has moved most of its trades away from Enron to other exchanges, such as Intercontinenal Exchange, a venture it formed in March 2000 with other partners including BP Plc and Goldman, Sachs & Co., Mirant spokesman James Peters said. ``We are still trading with them, but on a very limited basis,'' said Peters.       ``Dynegy has to act fast,'' said Roger Hamilton, a money manager with John Hancock Advisers Inc., which sold its Enron shares in recent weeks. ``If Enron can't get financing and its bonds go to junk, they lose counterparties and their marvelous business vanishes.''       Dynegy would gain a wholesale energy business, the leading energy manager for commercial and small-industrial customers, and an Internet energy trading operation many times larger than its own, said UBS Warburg LLC analyst James Yanello.       ``If history is any guide, Dynegy is stingy when it comes to acquisitions, so I don't expect them to do anything stupid'' such as overpaying for Enron, said Yanello. ``A deal could provide Dynegy with tremendous opportunity.'' He rates Dynegy ``strong buy'' and doesn't own shares of either company.       ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns about 27 percent of Dynegy, is considering adding $1.5 billion to the transaction to help Enron. It would provide another $1 billion when the purchase is closed, the New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported.                          Breakup Fee       The companies agreed on a breakup fee providing Dynegy with about $400 million if Enron accepts a higher offer, people familiar with the talks said.       Dynegy's shares rose as much as $4.30, or 13 percent, to $37.30. The stock had dropped $3 yesterday when news of the Enron talks was first reported.       Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer and ChevronTexaco spokesman Fred Gorell declined to comment.      Enron plans to meet with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and other lenders tomorrow to discuss the merger plans and a possible increase in the amount the company pays for existing credit lines, according to bankers familiar with the matter.       The company has invited more than 300 creditors to its offices in Houston to listen to presentations by Enron's financial team, led by its new chief financial officer, Jeffrey McMahon, the bankers said.       Dynegy began in 1985 as Natural Gas Clearinghouse, a gas- trading company. In 1998, the company took the name Dynegy -- a combination of the words dynamic and energy -- to reflect its expansion beyond natural gas. Chuck Watson, the company's president from 1985, became chairman and chief executive in 1989.       Watson is an investor with Enron CEO Lay in the Houston Texans, who begin playing in the National Football League next year, and is a board member at Baker Hughes Inc. As of an April filing with the SEC, Watson owned 12.3 million Dynegy shares, or about 5.1 percent of the common stock.      DJ FABER REPORT: More On Enron/Dynegy >ENE 2001-11-08 16:00 (New York)      (The following is a portion of a report aired at 3 p.m. Thursday by CNBC reporter David Faber).   Enron and Dynegy are still talking about a deal that would result in Enron's purchase by Dynegy. And they would like to either announce a transaction or the lack of one, in the near term. It's still unclear at what price Enron would be purchased, or if the deal will end up as a large investment. People close to the talks do not expect a large premium.    A key challenge at present for Dynegy is whether it can conduct enough due diligence of an incredibly complex financial structure to feel comfortable with a takeover.    That point was made clear today given Enron just released restated financial results for the last four years of operations. Its peak earnings in 2000 had been $1.12 a share. Now those earnings have been restated to 97 cents.    The key to Enron's restatement is the treatment of three off balance sheet partnerships whose debt is guaranteed by Enron. Given that guarantee, Enron's auditors have now concluded the partnerships should have been included on Enron's books.    The debt from the partnership has been included in recent quarters, but not for years previous. And if it had been, Enron might not have been able to employ as much leverage in running its business and supercharge the returns on some of its trades.    While Dynegy understands Enron's trading business as well as any company could, it still would seem to need time to review its trading book.    With the restatement, Enron's return on capital and return on equity is in the mid-single digits. That's well below the ROEs of banks and brokers which Enron most closely resembles in its trading activities.    Other issues are also sure to be explored. For example, why did Enron have to extend deposits to counter parties during the June 2001 quarter if business was so good, as would appear to have been the case given the company's strong earnings?    And what about Enron's use of derivatives for these relatively new type trades?    All these are questions that Dynegy may not have time to answer and so instead may be seeking an expansive material adverse change clause in any merger agreement which will give it wide latitude to exit a deal should it discover things it doesn't like in the future.    Dynegy, Enron negotiating merger Enron fires two officers; financial results to be restated  CBSMarketWatch.com Lisa Sanders NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- Enron's troubles deepened Thursday as the energy merchant confirmed it's in merger talks with Dynegy and announced, in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, that it fired two officers and is restating financial results for four years and two quarters. Both Dynegy and Enron confirmed Thursday that they're in negotiations following a published report that an $8 billion deal was close to being finalized.  The New York Times reported that Dynegy's board approved a stock offer worth $10 a share for Enron.  While confirming the talks, the companies released no further details. Dynegy had no additional comment. An Enron spokeswoman stonewalled reporters Thursday by saying the company was requiring all questions to be submitted in writing. Enron did not respond to the questions. Shares of Enron (ENE ) initially rallied but closed at $8.41, down 64 cents, or 7.1 percent, while Dynegy (DYN ) tacked on $3.50 to close at $36.50. ChevronTexaco (CVX ), which owns 27 percent of Dynegy, will contribute $2.5 billion to the deal, the Times reported. ChevronTexaco, which added 31 cents to close at $87.59, declined to comment. Also Thursday, Enron in an SEC filing said it has fired its treasurer, Ben Glisan, and the general counsel of an Enron division, Kristina Mordaunt. Earlier in the month, Enron fired chief financial officer Andy Fastow for his role in limited partnerships that are now under investigation by the SEC.  Enron restated its financial results for the years 1997 through 2000 and the first two quarters of 2001. Enron has lost most of its market value over the past month after the SEC launched a probe of some transactions by company executives.  Enron would bring huge debt A merger of Dynegy and Enron would require the smaller company to take on the $12.8 billion in debt that's now on Enron's books. The acquisition would likely lead to the sale of additional Enron assets to pay down the debts, the Times reported.  Boards of both companies were meeting in Houston on Wednesday night, according to the paper.  "If you look at the balance sheets of Dynegy and Enron, (a merger) would be a tough deal," Jeff Dietert of Simmons & Co. He noted that Dynegy (DYN ) has $3 billion worth of debt and a market capitalization of $11.7 billion.  "Enron's debt load is likely to be too significant for Dynegy to step up and swallow," Dietert said. For Dynegy to make the deal, it would have to issue equity, he added.  It would make more sense for Dynegy to consider buying some Enron assets, Dietert said. That would also help Enron clean up its balance sheet.  Chris Ellinghaus of Williams Capital Group said that ChevronTexaco's involvement would make a Dynegy-Enron combination more realistic. "We would view this transaction favorably assuming Dynegy intends to dispose of Enron's myriad of non-core businesses," Ellinghaus said. Dynegy and Enron together would dwarf other natural gas and power marketers in the U.S.  Ellinghaus said the possibility that Dynegy would buy Enron is "staggering." "However, the failure of Enron to procure an outside equity infusion has apparently severely limited Enron's options," he said. "We do not believe the potential demise of Enron invalidates the merchant energy model or suggest deeper problems within the wholesale energy markets." Gregory Phelps, vice president and portfolio manager of John Hancock's Patriot Group of closed-end income funds, said Enron, even in its current state, retains some intrinsic value.  "Enron still has an incredible number of contractual trading arrangements out there that can't be allowed to crumble and fall," he added. "I think that a firm like Dynegy with a firm like ChevronTexaco as partner adds the credibility that Enron needs." Dynegy gets to buy "assets on the cheap" that it can tie into its own growth-oriented operations, he said. Phelps has never owned Enron stock in his funds because he says it's too volatile and the company makes it too hard to understand how it generates revenue. Bush ties  Enron's Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay stepped back into the CEO spot following the abrupt departure of Jeffrey K. Skilling, who left after just six months on the job for "personal reasons." Skilling was called to testify in Washington, D.C., this week, though the SEC would not confirm whether it was before their agency. In a conference call with investors Wednesday, El Paso Energy Chairman and Chief Executive William Wise said his company would consider buying some of Enron's assets, though he declined to specify which ones.  "We are an asset-oriented company, and we would look at their assets," Wise said. "Rather than list any of them for you, you can make your own judgments."  Wednesday, A.G. Edwards cut its rating on Enron to "sell" from "hold," saying the only reason to own the stock now would be to bet that some company would bid for Enron or a large part of its wholesale trading operations. Azurix divestiture  Also Thursday, Azurix Corp., an affiliate of Enron, said it sold its Azurix North America and Azurix Industrial to American Water Works for $141.5 million in cash and the assumption of $6.1 million of debt. Azurix is a water and wastewater company. In the third quarter, Enron took a $1 billion charge, which included $287 million for asset impairments at Azurix.

313,"Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets   Wow!  What a year 2001 has been for the supporters of energy competition.   For every good bit of news (Pat Wood, one of our heroes at CAEM, being selected to head the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the continuing progress that the Canadians ? yes, the Canadians ? have made towards energy competition), we have had to bear one disaster and misstep after another throughout the year.   Let?s see, in December 2000, who could have predicted?.  1.  The tragic events of September 11th. 2.  The California implosion. 3.  Pennsylvania marketer retrenchment. 4.  Price volatility and high prices (but it could have been worse if Mother Nature did not help out). 5.  Bush Energy Plan ignores meaningful restructuring. 6.  Enron collapse. 7.  FERC Blinks on Super RTO. 8.  Texas missteps in pilots for opening the market. 9.  No leadership emerged to meet the crisis in restructuring.  2001 was one heck of a year ? but thankfully, probably the nadir of the movement towards energy competition in North America.  As CAEM looks into our crystal ball (natural gas fired, of course) for the coming year, we see a better year.  Below are some of the predictions and responses from the CAEM staff about what we expect to occur.  The responses below are primarily concerned with electricity, but to a lesser extent, may be applied to natural gas as well.  As always, do not bet the house on what we have to say.  We are just a little think tank, kind of like the little engine that could.  And we can.  And we do.  Happy New Year!		  The CAEM Staff  P.S. If you would like to add a prediction or two, please send an e-mail with your name and contact information to Hope Duncan at hduncan@caem.org  We will post them to our web site ? www.caem.org  Please identify which question below is being addressed by your prediction.  CAEM PREDICTIONS IN 2002  What does Enron?s collapse mean?  1. Markets work.  Markets quickly punish mistakes.  Little slack is given for past accomplishments.  Markets are ruthlessly impersonal.   2. No likely short term impact on consumers, other traders will fill the space left by Enron.  Amazing that a company as large as Enron can fail and hardly cause a ripple in markets.  Testimonial to benefits of markets.   3. May have significant impact on public policy advocacy.  Not obvious who picks up the slack.  Enron could be counted on to be there, or so it appeared.  No more free riders, we will all have to dig deeper and work harder.  Consumers may be mid to long term losers if movement toward competition collapses, which it might do if states stretch out the transition period to competition.    4. Enron?s collapse was not caused by deregulation. Viewed thoughtfully, it should not have any effect on deregulation movement.  Does not stand for proposition that deregulation is not the right policy.   5. Look for more regulation and oversight of energy transactions, accounting and business practices.  A strange legacy for Enron, but a reality.   6. As a practical matter, it is another setback for restructuring.  But not as bad as portrayed by media ? Enron was the 600 pound gorilla that angered friends of competition almost as much as foes, thus making them less willing to step forward.  Will feed growing skepticism many have about restructuring.   7. Enron?s global reach into wholesale and retail markets meant that its policy positions were sometimes blurred (pro-wholesale? pro energy services?) Other corporations will now replace Enron in public policy debates; these corporations may have a clearer focus.    8. Still, we have lost a champion.  CAEM will miss their culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations, which led to the unbundling of the classic power contract (or paper or water, etc) into its constituent parts and offered customers choices on each one. Enron also pioneered risk assessment and control systems.   What will be the fate of the movement towards retail energy competition in 2002?   1. CAEM believes that the movement toward retail energy competition will continue ? albeit much more slowly.   2. Texas is the best model to date and will set the standard for other states in 2002 and beyond.  Why?  The best incentives are in place for large numbers of commercial and industrial consumers to competitively shop for supply.  The Texas model ties changes to the wholesale market to the retail market.  (Texas, through ERCOT, is unique in this respect.)  No price caps.  Market power of incumbents is limited.  Enlightened leadership at the Texas PUC from 1995 to 2000 (our friend, Pat Wood again ? but we believe Commissioner Perlman is a star as well) and in the Governor?s office.   3. Other states that have already made a decision to move forward will seek to correct deficiencies ? Pennsylvania, New Jersey, etc. ? or avoid past mistakes altogether ? Virginia.  However, there will be very limited movement in these states.   4. California will continue to suffer from a lack of imagination and poor leadership from the Governor on down.  There is a good chance that CAEM will again be awarding Governor Davis the ?Red China? award in 2002.   5. Californians will be reminded again that rolling blackouts are a form of ?involuntary? conservation.   6. Very limited movement, perhaps some experimentation or demonstration projects, in those states that have done nothing to date.   7. Increasing effort to approximate market-like conditions, but under a regulated, cost-based system, with predictable results.    8. Actually, beyond Texas, the best hope for significant movement towards competition is in North America is in Canada, particularly Alberta and Ontario.  Given the increasing interconnection between the U.S. and Canada, this will slowly work its way into the United States.    9. It will be another wild ride for energy marketers in 2002.  More power to them.   What will happen on the wholesale side of the picture in 2002?   1. CAEM believes that there will be significant strides made to increase liquidity and competition in the wholesale market for electricity.   2. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will be successful, to a degree, in implementing Super RTOs (regional transmission organizations).   3. CAEM supports the Bush Administration?s proposal to give eminent domain to FERC for the siting of new transmission lines.  However, this proposal faces tough sledding in Congress.  CAEM believes it will pass in some form ? probably very watered down ? out of necessity, but not out of love. Many in Congress still believe we can conserve our way to prosperity.   4. The Federal government and the states will make progress ? probably embodied in a political deal ? on greater cooperation.  This will be regional in focus.  Both sides will give significant concessions to realize this.    5. New players will enter market as it grows, including the oil companies and more foreign-based companies.    Wildcards/ Predictions in 2002   1. The Bush Administration will come under increasing pressure to show leadership in the area of energy restructuring.  To date, the Bush Administration has stayed on the sidelines ? except making the right noises here and there ? of making energy markets more competitive.  This will need to change, beginning with more funds and staff devoted to helping the states on the retail side and supporting FERC in their efforts on the wholesale side.   2. The new Electricity Advisory Board appointed by DOE Secretary Abraham will be seen for what it is ? a sop to campaign supporters.  Given its current make up, we expect very little to come of it.  Couldn?t they find more energy marketers, technology companies ? anyone that is a bit more pro-competition?  3. The Department of Energy will continue to have little impact -- if any -- on energy restructuring issues and will remain largely irrelevant to the competitive energy market.   4. The Department of Energy will continue to fight for tougher appliance efficiency standards, while totally ignoring the far lower efficiency of electricity production, thus marginalizing its impact on energy efficiency.   5. ?Comprehensive? energy legislation will probably pass in 2002.  The question is whether it will be truly comprehensive and have a separate and new section devoted to electric restructuring.  (The Senate version does and the House is working on one.)  Our guess is that it will to some degree.  Our hope is that the energy legislation moves beyond pork politics and members of Congress will resist the temptation to earmark projects.  Fat chance of that happening, but it is Christmas time.   6. As part of the political deal, there is the opportunity for a ?New Federalism? policy to be realized for the energy sector.  If the Bush Administration truly wants to move competition forward, and yet have the states go along with it, a new block grant with conditions for moving towards competition could be formed to serve as a carrot.  The Feds do it with highway funds and education ? why not energy? The states, familiar with federal block grants for highways and education will try to cut as many of the ?strings? attached to the grants as possible.   7. A major blackout in 2002.  The laws of probability suggest that we are due for a reminder about how old our infrastructure is and how the lack of attention to how these markets are performing will have consequences.  The U.S. has dodged many bullets in the past ? but probably not this year. (BPA will likely not cause the blackout this time, as it did twice in 1996, unless the Pacific Northwest gets a lot of snow this winter or a lot of rain this spring.) ( The blackout will likely not happen in Manhattan, since peak demand was reduced by ~ 300 mW on September 11th.)  We recognize this a risky prediction ? predicting what terrorists or what the weather may do always is ? but it is only a matter of time.   8. The environmental movement will begin to wake up to the fact that its interests are not the same as those of consumer activists.  Competition will lead to more efficient production ? and thus less pollution ? to the extent it is allowed to occur.  Seeking lower prices at all costs, including the cost to the environment, consumer advocates want to preserve the monopoly model, which has led and will continue to lead to the maximum use of old, and polluting technologies and infrastructure.   9. For that matter, the anti-coalition (kind of like anti-matter, not much there) of critics should splinter even further vs. organized labor (high costs, high prices).   10. New grid-enhancing technologies, e.g., superconductivity, and distributed energy technologies, e.g., fuel cells, should make significant market gains in 2002, assuming Congress, DOE and EPA take no further actions to prevent this from happening.  There is a lot of pessimism in the distributed energy community right now ? and who wouldn?t be a bit pessimistic, given the exit of Honeywell from the market, the constant technical setbacks, the wariness of the utilities, the bickering and backbiting, etc.  But folks, this is the future ? and the future starts now.   11. EPA will continue to protect the ?right? of existing generators to pollute at rates an order of magnitude greater than the pollution rates required of new generators, ?in the interest of fairness?.   12. EPA will continue to discourage incremental improvements in the efficiency and emissions of existing power plants by insisting that the incremental improvements subject the plants to new source review.   13. EPA will proceed with issuance of a proposed guidance document requiring combined heat and power systems and building cooling, heating and power systems to achieve better combined electrical and thermal efficiency than the best available separate electric generation and thermal energy conversion technologies, but will not require that all separate electric generation and thermal energy conversion installations use the best available technology. (No one will question why this efficiency requirement is coming from EPA and not DOE.)   14. The tax code will continue to require owners of on-site generation systems to depreciate the systems over time periods longer than their expected useful lives.",0,0,0

319,"Are you putting words in my mouth Tim.    The East is absolutely adamant about having a liquid real-time energy markets  with a "real supply curve" and a "real demand curve" such that hourly  clearing prices reflect the true economic value of the commodity.   With  respect to the number of hourly price signals within an RTO that is  necessary, that is subject to much debate.   Although I prefer a zonal model  for simplicity reasons, the reality is that congestion is more prevalent in  the East in most of the markets and in order to get a functioning real time  energy market, we may have settle for a limited LMP, in which nodal pricing  is necessary for managing the congestion, but proxy buses are created in  zones (3-5 per RTO) for purposes of real-time energy markets.  Our views, I believe, are still very much aligned, however, I need to make  some progress on the creation of real time energy markets.   The zonal  markets implemented in NEPOOL and contemplated for ERCOT result in a  mis-priced commodity with no "real" price signal sent to the market.   Out of  merit generation is and will continue to be dispatched because the congestion  is managed through energy uplift payments (congestion price signal is not  sent to the market).   This results in a very inefficient commodity market  where the consumer gets screwed and market makers can't price the commodity  or transportation on a forward basis.  I hope this clarifies any misunderstanding.",0,0,0

People  have cut the power lines. They just reschedule."  In an e-mail message sent Wednesday, the executive vice chancellor, Paul R.  Gray, advised instructors to use "individual discretion to decide the  disposition of their examinations once the exam has started."Among the  options: delay the test until the lights return; postpone it until a  Saturday; grade the incomplete test; or cancel the exam altogether.Professors are also encouraged to check a Web site to see if their exam rooms  have windows."In some classrooms," Mr. Gray noted, "students may have  sufficient natural light."  The rolling blackouts could hit most of the campuses of the University of  California and California State University.The two systems are embroiled in  a legal dispute with Enron Energy Services, a Houston-based company that, in  February, cut short a four-year contract to provide electricity directly to  the universities.For now, the two systems -- among the largest energy  consumers in the state -- are being supplied by Pacific Gas and Electric and  Southern California Edison.Though several medical centers and the Davis, Los Angeles and Riverside  campuses of the University of California system are exempt from the  blackouts, the rest of the campuses have been put on alert.At Berkeley, the warning from Mr. Gray only heightened pre-exam stress  levels."Stopping in the middle of a final would be detrimental to my grade because  I save the hardest questions until the end," said Heidi West, 20, a  sophomore majoring in political science.Aaron Chung, a senior studying cognitive science, said it would be unfair to  grade half-finished exams because he often circled answers instinctively,  planning to return later with more care."The only thing I don't have a  problem with is if the professors give everyone A's," Mr. Chung, 23, said."You have to be under a lot of duress for that to happen."  Gary L. Firestone, a biology professor, said he would move his 500-member  class out into the sunshine and tell students to spread their blue books on  the grass.But Jeff Good, a graduate student who teaches Introduction to  Syntax and Semantics, said he would probably cancel the exam because the  final counts for only 20 percent of the grade.That is what Michelle Chen, a junior linguistics major in Mr. Good's class,  is hoping for."I would love a blackout," Ms. Chen said."I'm going to turn on my  air-conditioner. My toaster, too."  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Business British Telecom Patience Wheatcroft  05/12/2001 The Times of London News International Final 4 55 (Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 2001)  BRITISH TELECOM has inflicted enough damage on itself in the past year.But  others are still lining up to put the boot in.Hours after the company  announced a Pounds 5.9 billion rights issue and the separation of cash-hungry  BT Wireless, Moody's Investors Service lowered BT's credit rating.This  thumbs-down will cost BT an extra Pounds 35 million a year on existing loans  as well as making future working capital more expensive.The timing is odd.One of the two other main agencies presented with the same  BT proposals maintained its rating and the other edged it down so little that  change-of-rating clauses were not triggered.In the meantime, the market  prices of BT debt have been rising.The Enron Cost of Credit, which measures  the overall risk premium on BT borrowing, has halved since mid February.Such  costly inconsistencies must focus more critical attention on the agencies,  whose power has grown out of proportion to their accountability.Moody's verdict is, however, peanuts compared with the cost to BT of the  whims of Stephen Byers and the UK competition authorities.Moody's will no  doubt be aghast to learn that Yell could be worth Pounds 1 billion less as a  result.In 1996 the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that BT's Yellow Pages  had an 85 per cent monopoly of its market and made it sign undertakings to  cut prices by 2 per cent a year in real terms.The Office of Fair Trading has  reviewed this report; predictably, it has found that the enforced price cuts  have kept competition down and kept Yell's market share up.The reasoning behind OFT advice that annual real price cuts should be doubled  is closed to scrutiny until Mr Byers has a new BT undertaking.But it appears  to argue that the market is still a monopoly, so Yell must be charging too  much, so prices should fall further.The result, according to those formerly eager to buy Yell, is that a growth  business has been turned into a stagnant one, losing all momentum.This  sounds typical of the dead hand of UK regulation.It must strengthen the  resolve of BT's new leaders to remodel what the authorities so hate to the  greater advantage of shareholders.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.OUTLOOK Outlook Houston needs to think small about future technology WILLIAM DYLAN POWELL  05/13/2001 Houston Chronicle 2 STAR 4 (Copyright 2001)  OK, it's test time - sort of like a breakfast-time Rorschach test for Outlook  readers.Here we go: What's the first thing that comes to mind when someone  mentions Houston?Time's up.Your answers may have been energy, medicine or seemingly random  acts of highway closure.But how about something very, very small?While  Houston may not exactly be synonymous with all things tiny, we may want to  start giving more mind share to the world of the miniature.As technology  advances, Houston may owe a great deal to the study of small substances.Nanotechnology is the study of creating functional structures on a molecular  scale (the prefix "nano" means one billionth, or 10 to the ninth power  numerically).Its theories and practices give scientists the means to  construct useful entities using the smallest known particle of unaltered  matter.Before your eyes glaze over in a terminology-induced science class flashback,  you should hear some of the possibilities that this technology could afford  residents of the Bayou City and their respective commercial enterprises.The  possibilities give the works of science fiction author Ray Bradbury a run for  their money, and include producing computers the size of viruses or factories  that could fit neatly on your desk.Cancer-destroying robots could roam a  patient's innards like mounted police at a spring break celebration.Eventually, all diseases and mutations could be eliminated.And all  manufacturing processes would become waste-free, both in terms of the  environment and from a business process standpoint.Sound like science fiction?Maybe, but truth is rapidly catching up with  fiction.A team of university researchers recently figured out how to make a  functional switch out of a single organic molecule.Discoveries such as these  have spawned several branch fields of study including nanobiotics, NEMS  (nanoelectromechanical systems) and nanomedicine.This technology would surely change the world.But it would especially affect  Houston.Applications for nanotechnology are a great fit for Houston's  economic landscape.The chemical industry already has begun conducting  research in small-sizing certain chemical compounds.And the energy industry,  still our darling, has great interest in the power management possibilities  of nanotech.This could be Houston's next great vehicle for economic  development.Nay-sayers have expressed caution regarding progress in this field on two  separate fronts.First on how distant potential commercial offerings remain;  and secondly on the potential dangers of combining genetic engineering,  nanotechnology and robotics (for fear of creating self-assembling intelligent  machines as often portrayed in science-fiction movies).But too much  technological progress is happening at once for the possibilities not to whet  the appetites of the entire scientific and business communities.Already, developmental overtures have been heard from Houston's little sister  to the north.The Dallas-Fort Worth region and its growing base of  semiconductor, light assembly and defense industries are keeping a close eye  on developments in small science.In March, a private-sector company donated  $2.5 million to the University of Texas at Dallas for nanotech research.And  a handful of Dallas-area groups have been quietly conducting research of  their own.This money augments the federal government's nearly half-billion  dollar allotment of 2001 research funding for nanotechnology.Houston has its  own projects, but they receive far less publicity.Houston's public nanoscience efforts have been centered mostly on Rice  University's grand Turks of academia.Pushing the envelope of academic  excellence as usual, Rice's heavyweight research barons continue to generate  and distribute knowledge on the many potential applications of this exciting  technology.But as successful as they are, they receive far less publicity  and support than other less commercially significant disciplines.On May 29, leaders from the energy, medical and technology sectors will  converge at the Houston Technology Forum to discuss various technology trends  that will affect Houston's future.Will the keynote speakers (chief  executives from Compaq, the Texas Medical Center and Enron) address the issue  of what Houston is doing to prepare for advances in nanotechnology and its  potential economic impact on the region?I certainly hope so.Energy, medicine and technology are the terra firma of  Houston's economy.Each of these industry sectors could reap profound  benefits by bringing nanotechnology's concepts to light.Sure, the fruits of this nascent science are still a long way off.But it's  going to become remarkably important sooner than we think.So while  Houstonians are well known for our love of largeness, it's time to think  small.Let's take a careful evaluation of what this technology could mean to  our city and its economic development.Drawing   Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.A Panel plots new course for area's future / Education, economics, quality of  life top group's list of needed improvements MIKE SNYDER Staff  05/13/2001 Houston Chronicle 4 STAR 33 (Copyright 2001)  A group of prominent business executives, worried that Houston's reputation  as an unpleasant place to live imperils its future, is developing a plan to  transform the city's educational system, urban design and economic base.The work of the Center for Houston's Future, a nonprofit group affiliated  with the Greater Houston Partnership, reflects growing concern that Houston  must reposition itself as a vibrant, desirable destination if it is to  compete in an economic climate that empowers skilled workers to live wherever  they choose.Creating such a "livable city," leaders of the effort say, would in turn  enrich the lives of every Houstonian."The interests of the business community are fully aligned with the interests  of the community at large," said Eugene H. Vaughan, a money management  executive and board chairman of the Center for Houston's Future.A report prepared for the organization by a business-based task force  recommends that local leaders challenge long-held assumptions that have  discouraged meaningful land-use planning.It sketches a vision of Houston 20  years from now in which technology and other tools have revolutionized public  education, "livable city centers" have changed the physical landscape and  current civic leaders have groomed a new, more diverse generation of  successors.The report argues that the business community's traditional leadership role  in Houston's civic affairs should continue.But it suggests the models of  business influence that prevailed in "the old days" should be re-examined."Those were the days when oil was king, and Houston was the energy capital of  the world - the days when a handful of 'big' leaders, including CEOs of major  corporations, could meet in a room together and decide on the future of  Houston," the report states."But times have changed, and there is far less tolerance in Houston's highly  diverse, egalitarian society for a hidden oligarchy to run things, no matter  how benevolent those leaders might be."  The center's board includes top executives of some of Houston's most  successful and influential companies, including Enron Chairman Ken Lay; Ned  Holmes, chairman and CEO of Parkway Investments/Texas Inc.; James Royer,  president and CEO of Turner, Collie & Braden Inc.; William White, president  and CEO of WEDGE Group Inc.; and Jim Kollaer, president and CEO of the  Greater Houston Partnership.Vaughan said the stature of the board members is an indication that the group  is not likely to generate plans that will simply sit on a shelf."They've got so many demands on their time that they're not going to fool  around with something that is ill-conceived," he said.Rice University sociology professor Stephen Klineberg, one of the experts who  advised the task force that generated the report, agreed that the center's  work could be very influential."This is the first time there's been a systematic, coordinated effort on the  part of the business community" to improve Houston's quality of life,  Klineberg said.The Center for Houston's Future was created in the early 1990s primarily as a  source of research information for the partnership, Houston's premier  business organization.But its role changed about two years ago, Vaughan  said, when Holmes became chairman of the partnership and encouraged the  center to take an aggressive approach to planning for the region's future.Last summer, the center organized three workshops attended by 36 people  representing a cross section of the business community.These 10-day,  seven-night events, led by professional facilitators and featuring various  guest speakers, produced a report outlining four possible future Houston  scenarios.James D. Calaway, a member of the center's board, said the details outlined  in the four scenarios are intended to be "illustrative" and are not  necessarily the actions the organization ultimately will recommend.However,  they provide insight into the direction of the group's thinking, he said.In the first scenario, based on the assumption that local planning and  decision-making proceed much as they have in the past, the workshop  participants speculate that tension between the city and suburbs increases to  the point that the Legislature strips Houston of its annexation power.Development is greatly restricted because of failure to meet clean-air  standards, property values plummet and the City Council must pass a large tax  rate increase.Houston becomes a stronghold of low-wage, service-sector employment, and the  gap between rich and poor widens: "For many who live there, it's simply a  large urban sprawl, adrift in the global economy, or it's a three-year  hardship post on the way to something more desirable."  Scenario two suggests that Houston's leaders transform the educational system  by developing a "Teacher Network" that delivers Internet-based educational  resources into every classroom and teacher's home in the region.This in turn  leads to a communitywide electronic educational network, with every home in  the Houston area connected to the Internet by 2007.These efforts, combined with universal, full-day preschool care, lead to  state-of-the-art local schools by 2010, with almost universal high school  graduation rates and 75 percent of these graduates going on to college or  technical training programs.The report does not estimate the cost of these measures or identify how they  would be funded.Potential sources, Calaway said, include local, state and  federal tax money, private grants and reallocation of funds now being spent  on more traditional educational programs.In scenario three, local leaders take bold steps to overcome Houston's  reputation for sprawl, dirty air and lack of green space - perceptions that  hamper efforts to attract the talent needed to keep the region economically  competitive.These leaders develop a vision of Houston based on the creation of "livable  city centers" - major activity centers targeted for redesign and  redevelopment - and the connection of these centers through "personal and  public transport in corridors that delight the eye."  Within the centers, streets are reconstructed to better accommodate  pedestrians.Financial incentives prompt developers to provide a wide range  of housing styles, including substantial affordable housing.The Main Street  light rail line is built, succeeds spectacularly and is followed by more rail  lines extending in various directions.To accomplish these goals, the report states, local leaders must overcome  their "ingrained suspicion of planning," and the City Council must adopt  "new, more prescriptive development standards" within the livable city  centers.Early successes lead to a public referendum authorizing the  expenditure of $8 billion over 20 years to create the "livable city."  Scenario four focuses on making Houston a "crossroads of the world economy."  The city's business leadership becomes broader and more diverse, and it turns  its energy toward diversifying the economy.The energy industry, adapting to the new economic climate, transforms its  business model and creates new, high-tech enterprises.Space, nanotechnology  and biotechnology research help launch hundreds of companies that quickly  become significant global players.The workshop participants concluded that Houston must accomplish key elements  of scenarios two, three and four if it is to become a "true world-class city  in which to live and conduct business."  Calaway and Vaughan said the next steps will include designating committees  to develop specific recommendations in each of the broad areas studied, such  as education and quality of life.Working groups then will be established to  begin translating these ideas into policy, they said.Although the center is focused on the long term, they said, it must produce  results as soon as possible."If we do not get serious about this, 20 years from now we're going to be a  low-wage environment, putting people in very, very dead- end jobs," Calaway  said during a recent presentation on the group's work to members of the  nonprofit Gulf Coast Institute."We've got to get the quality of life right, but we've also got to make sure  that we educate these kids for our future."

At present, the Dolphin project is  being developed primarily as an upstream venture," an industry source told  MEED.Another industry publication, Middle East Economic Survey (MEES), reported  last week that the two other partners regarded Enron's estimated cost for  constructing and laying the 350-kilometre (220- mile) undersea pipeline as  too high."There is talk of new partners," a source with TotalFinaElf, whose role is to  develop a block in Qatar's giant North Field, told MEED."But whatever  happens, we are staying."  On March 14, Qatar and the UAE inked a 25-year term sheet agreement on the  project, setting the volume at two billion cubic feet (20 million cubic  metres) of natural gas per day.Differences over pricing and volumes had put back the signing of the  agreement for two years after a first statement of principle for Dolphin was  inked by Qatar and UOG in March 1999.According to MEES, Qatar Petroleum and UOG have finally agreed on a gas price  formula of 1.3 dollars per million BTU (British thermal units) following  "high-level political intervention from Qatar and Abu Dhabi".TotalFinaElf and Enron are strategic partners in the multi- billion-dollar  project, each holding a 24.5 percent share in Dolphin Energy Limited (DEL),  with UOG retaining a controlling 51 percent stake.From Abu Dhabi, the gas is to be distributed inside the emirate and on to  Dubai and Oman.An extension to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline is also  planned, as part of a regional gas network.hc/rp  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.BUSINESS SMALL BUSINESS / Pleasure cruisin' / Yacht fleet owner offers customers what  amounts to limo service on the lake CAROL RUST Special to the Chronicle  05/13/2001 Houston Chronicle 2 STAR 1 (Copyright 2001)  KEMAH - Tom Lober trundled home from second grade with a three- tiered wooden  box he'd made at school."This is my houseboat," he told his mother 35 years ago."When I grow up, I'm  going to live on a boat."His practical-minded mother put the "boat" to work as a patio plant stand  until it finally rotted from a decade of exposure.On a recent evening, Lober stood on the bow of one of his four charter  yachts, enjoying the sunset-tinted water and a mild breeze as the 100-foot  luxury boat moved quietly from Clear Lake into Galveston Bay."This is what I love," Lober said, scanning a horizon dotted with distant  boats."The others are here to party, but this is it for me."  The founder and owner of Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts spoke calmly against  the din of a mini-Mardi Gras heating up on middeck, where bead-clad  executives were letting their hair down at their annual appreciation party  for a major customer.A Mae West look- alike hired for the event meandered  among them, handing out cigars and sultry comments in her mermaid-cut white  dress studded with faux pearls and a white feather boa twirled about her  neck.In the eight and one-half years since the 42-year-old Lober started Star  Fleet, he's seen everything from fire-eaters to hula dancers as entertainment  on the hundreds of custom cruises his staff of 70 puts together each year.Last year, the company booked 400 cruises, which translated into $2.3 million  in gross sales, in events ranging from Gulf Coast versions of company picnics  to a bat mitzvah with a Gilligan's Island theme.One guy recently plunked  down $2,000 to charter an entire boat for a date.One of Lober's seven captains is, handily, a licensed minister for weddings.Star Fleet staff recently added squirt guns, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks as  regular on-board equipment."It's a bizarre business," Lober said."Nothing seems unusual anymore."  Nearly all Star Fleet's cruises include dinner.His kitchen staff does the  prep work for hors d'oeuvres and main courses on land near the marina,  transferring them to a generous galley on board before customers arrive.The  galley crew does the final cooking.Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts is one of about a dozen businesses of its  size in the country that provides strictly private charter yacht cruises, but  Lober has hundreds of competitors locally."I'm competing with caterers, hotels, restaurants - anyone in the eating,  drinking and party business," he said."People say there are two things  you're never supposed to own: a boat and a restaurant. I put a restaurant on  a boat."  Last month, he launched what he believes is the first-ever water limousine, a  30-foot yacht complete with wet bar, sound system, leather couches, TV and  VCR that takes small groups to waterfront restaurants and bars, just like a  limo does on land.Sometimes, his clients hop off and dine at one of the restaurants on the  Kemah Boardwalk while the limo is anchored beside it.In other cases, waiters  deliver the food to the boat, equipped with removable dining tables that can  seat 14, and the customers dine while cruising Clear Lake.Lober was a natural shoo-in for a career on the water.His father owned a  supply boat business in Houston and a fleet of shrimp boats based in  Trinidad.He eventually became president of his dad's supply boat business  after getting a master's degree in maritime management from Texas A&M  Maritime Academy in Galveston in 1981.But he still had that idea from second grade that grew from living on a boat  to providing exclusive entertainment on the water.In 1986, he joined the Passenger Vessel Association, a national group of  vessel owners that provides public or private cruises for gaming, ecotourism  or other entertainment.He attended seminars, talked to boat owners,  researched trends in the industry and tried to figure out what it would take  to float his idea.Lober drew up plans for a boat big enough to accommodate up to 150  passengers, but with a three-foot draft to keep from running aground in the  notoriously shallow Clear Lake and Galveston Bay."I wanted to be able to take that boat anywhere on the lake," which is five  feet deep in places, he said.Bankers were skeptical when he approached them for a loan."This was a new business in Houston that had never been done before," Lober  said."They had no confidence.  "I finally got to the point where I'd just take my business plan into a bank  and say, 'I know I'm not going to get a loan - just look at what I've got and  tell me what it needs,' " he said.  Even without a loan in place, Lober began hands-on research. During the week,  he still worked at his father's supply boat business, but flew to Fort  Lauderdale, Fla., on weekends to work as a deck hand and food server for a  charter yacht company to learn the business from the bottom up.  After a year of loan seeking, he found a lender at the Passenger Vessel  Association's annual meeting. Caterpillar Finance agreed to lend him 60  percent of the $950,000 in construction costs if he installed Caterpillar  engines on the boat.  Construction took a year, during which Lober continued his research, serving  drinks on weekends aboard a charter boat on the Detroit River and Lake St.  Clair.  Finally, Lober launched Star Gazer in October 1993.  The maritime academy might have taught him how to navigate by the stars, but  it didn't prepare him for marketing.  "I didn't know what I was doing," Lober said. "The first year, I spent  $125,000 in marketing blunders," including a $50,000 mass mail campaign that  he called "a total flop."  Marketing was twice as expensive as he thought it would be and took twice as  long for potential customers to understand the concept he was trying to sell,  he said. Meanwhile, his boat sat in the stall for up to three weeks at a  time.  Lober had a $30,000 monthly overhead in debt service, office rental,  insurance and slip fees, and "I still had to pay it if the boat didn't leave  once," he said.  Panicked, he joined the Greater Houston Partnership to seek out ideas, and he  got one: target marketing.  He and his small staff scrutinized every detail about the people who used the  boat and set out to find more like them. He set his sights on the corporate  client, which makes up about 70 percent of his business today. Corporate  customers include Enron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Continental Airlines and Katy  Mills mall.  "We have had our party with Star Fleet every year for five years," said Ravi  Lal, director of ethylene division of Technip, based in San Dimas, Calif.  "The first year, I wanted to do something special that I hadn't seen before.Everybody likes it, and everybody wants to come back."  Business slowly began to build, and word spread. Lober added the 90-foot Star  Cruiser in 1997, the 74-foot Star Spirit in 1999, and brought in a fourth,  the Lake Limo, last month. Also in 1999, he bought 6 acres with 600 feet of  waterfront and built Star Fleet Marina. While part of that land is still  undeveloped, it eventually will become a parking lot for 500 cars when Lober  adds a fifth large yacht, Star Ship, sometime in the future.  "We plan to add Star Ship when we're turning down enough business from the  other boats," he said.  After more than eight years, Lober has yet to take home a salary, putting  everything back into the business.  The more he puts back, the more business he can accommodate.  But Lober and his staff still keep close tabs on their customers.  "We track everything - which individuals, what type of event, whether they  prefer sit-down dinners, how they heard about us - you name it," he said.  It's a lot of details. He knows that blackout shades, pull-down projector  screens and multiple microphone jacks are needed for presentations, and that  some clients like to be picked up at one of the Galveston hotels or other  locations on the Houston Ship Channel.  If a customer hires a deejay, a crewmember provides padding to put underneath  the CD player on the bandstand because dancing on the steel dance floor  causes the player to bounce.  Lober's three full-time cruise consultants handle charter buses to and from  the marina, limos, menus, photographers and decorations. They work with Star  Fleet's in-house florist and theme designer to provide floral arrangements  for sit-down dinners and Hawaiian leis of fresh orchids and hibiscus for a  major retailer's party, for which the florist helped transform the boat's  stanchions into palm trees.  And consultants have their own suggestions, such as bestowing captains' hats  instead of the usual corsages to employees with top sales who were being  honored at a recent floating awards banquet.  Lober believes his company's custom service brings customers back.  "They handle all the details once, and after customers go on that first  cruise, they're sold on the concept," he said. "People love something  different.We provide a different kind of party.If they do it once, they  usually want to do it again."  But cruises aren't limited to parties, Lober said. Customers have chartered  boats for banquets, retreats, new product introductions, incentive awards  dinners and for scattering loved ones' ashes.  About 60 percent of Star Fleet's business is repeat and referral. The recent  corporate party featuring the Mae West look-alike was the fifth the company  has chosen to have with Star Fleet.  Part of Lober's initial marketing problem - which continues today - is that  Houstonians just don't realize how close to the water they are.  "It's not like Fort Lauderdale, where water is part of the landscape," he  said. "In Houston, there's no high-visibility location to see the water, just  one spot on Loop 610 that overlooks the Port of Houston.Even in Clear Lake,  there are only one or two places when you drive around the lake that you can  actually see the water.We don't have a San Francisco Bay or New York Harbor.So people have to be reminded."  He also has to deal with the misconception that only the very rich can afford  cruises, Lober said.  "Some people think they can't afford a luxury yacht, but when they compare  our complete package with upscale restaurants, hotel banquet facilities,  country clubs and wedding manors, we are quite competitive," he said. "And  our food is gourmet quality.Just like a five-star hotel, we never cut  corners."  Event cruises start at $40 per guest including food, bar, entertainment, tax  and gratuities.  Lober depends heavily on customer surveys to develop the service he and his  crew provide. And customers informally give Star Fleet staff new ideas with  some of the extras they bring aboard, such as the squirt guns, Mardi Gras  beads, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks.  "We learn a lot from our customers," he said. "We see what they do, take the  best and give it back to them."  Because customer surveys indicate that about 20 percent of Star Fleet's  business comes from being seen on the water, Lober and his captains make  their crafts as visible as possible whenever they take them out.The real  opportunity for hot-dogging comes when a customer charters two or three  boats, and they raft up to become the Star Fleet flotilla, with customers  moving from one boat to another.A three-boat charter can handle up to 375  guests.But one boat can still do a lot of advertising.At the recent corporate party, Mae West joined the other revelers who were  slinging Mardi Gras beads at al fresco diners as Capt. Tony DeFore edged Star  Gazer close to the Kemah waterfront.They may not have known it, but they  were doing a little of Lober's public relations work for him.As the boat pulled back into the Star Fleet Marina, Lober pointed out a barge  under construction.When it is finished - by the end of the year, he hopes -  the bottom floor will be a galley for food preparation, the second the Star  Fleet office and the third floor an 1,800-square-foot apartment.It will kind of resemble that three-tiered wooden box he brought home from  school years ago, Lober says.And he's going to live at the top.Photos: 1-2.Left: Star Gazer, first of the Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts,  launched in 1993, sets sail for Southshore Harbor earlier this month.From  left to right are bartender Bridget Byous, server Leona Clark, Cruise  Director Edith Mitchell and President Tom Lober.Below: Cruise Director Edith  Mitchell unties the Star Gazer's bow line (color);3.

But like the recent Montek Singh Ahluwalia report maintains, such reforms  cannot be done overnight and will require minimum five to seven years before  they break even.  The sector has already seen major exits like Cogentrix and Powergen and if  the current trends are anything to go by it would not be long before Enron  too says Sayonara India, claim sources in the power industry.  IPPAI, an association for private power investments, feels that the flip-flop  by the government as far as power policies are concerned have made it  difficult for investors to take decisions.  "Take this as an example at one time there were more than 200 MoUs signed up  for private power projects, the government provided counter guarantees for  eight projects, of which only three have taken off.Of this the Enron project  is already facing problems of nonpayment, says a senior source.According to estimates drawn up by financial institutions like Power Finance  Corporation an organisation responsible for monitoring the financial health  of the SEBs and helping them with their reform programmes almost all the SEBs  have registered a negative turnover.Which is why the financing or  escrowability of SEBs across the country has been reduced to zero.According to Union power minister Suresh Prabhu, the states are now  responsive to changes and reforms and the recent drive initiated by the  Centre to work with the state governments was expected to yield results.But this sector has seen far too many committees which have failed to yield  much hope and it is only sheer determination of SEBs and political will that  can help this backbencher.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.India Power Min: New Power Deal With Enron Unit Possible By Himendra Kumar Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  05/12/2001 Dow Jones International News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India is hopeful the Maharashtra State Electricity  Board's power purchase agreement with the U.S. energy company Enron Corp.'s  (ENE) Indian unit Dabhol Power Co. can be renegotiated and the DPC's dispute  over payments be settled, the country's federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu  said.In a weekend interview with Dow Jones Newswires, Prabhu said the very fact  that the DPC had come to the negotiating table for discussions on its power  price was an indication that Enron was keen to save its India project.A special panel, set up by the Maharashtra state government, met with  representatives of the DPC, for the first time Friday and agreed to another  meeting May 23.Friday's meeting lasted for more than two hours."I am of the view that a negotiated settlement is possible since the first  meeting of DPC with the Maharahtra state expert panel went off well. There  has been a positive response both from the DPC and the MSEB after the  meeting. The central government will also reciprocate by participating in a  meaningful dialogue. The next meeting will really decide on how it all goes,"  Prabhu said.Earlier this week, in an e-mail to Dow Jones Newswires from Houston, Enron  Vice President John Ambler however, said, "While we have constantly  maintained that we are open to continuing a dialogue towards resolving  issues, this (Friday) meeting should in no manner be construed as an open  offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract."  The Maharashtra state government contends that the price paid for electricity  from the Dabhol power plant, India's biggest-ever foreign investment at $2.9  billion, is "unaffordable" and seeks to renegotiate tariffs.A recent committee appointed by the government, the Godbole panel,  recommended that the power purchase agreement be renegotiated.Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power.Critics object to Dabhol charging 7.1 rupees ($1=INR46.8825) a kilowatt-hour  for its power, compared with INR1.5/kwh charged by other suppliers.The 2,184-megawatt DPC project in Maharashtra has been mired in financial  disputes after the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its main customer,  failed to pay the December 2000 and January bills.The Godbole panel is  working toward lowering the DPC's power tariff and allowing the sale of  excess power to the federal government or its utilities.A restructuring of  the DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda.The Maharashtra government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a  revised agreement within a month.The DPC currently operates a 740-megawatt  naphtha plant contributing about 0.7% to India's installed capacity.Enron  has maintained that work will be completed by the year-end in the second  phase of the Dabhol project that will add 1,444 MW to its capacity.The plant  will switch from naphtha to liquefied natural gas as a fuel source in 2002.Texas-based Enron has a 65% stake in the DPC and is the project's largest  shareholder.Other shareholders include the MSEB with 15%, and General  Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel Enterprises (X.BTL) with 10% each.-By Himendra Kumar, Dow Jones Newswires; 91-11-461-9427;  himendra.kumar@dowjones.com  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.India: Talks begin on Dabhol issue  05/12/2001 Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) -  Asia Intelligence Wire  MUMBAI, May 11.OFFICIALS of Enron India today met the expert committee  headed by Dr Madhav Godbole to discuss the fate of Enron's Dabhol Power  Company.Mr A.V. Gokak, Union Government representative, who was appointed only last  night, could not attend the meeting due to the short notice.Lenders to the project who were to attend the meeting stayed away.Instead, Mr A.G. Karkhanis, former Executive Director, Industrial Development  Bank of India, attended as observer on behalf of foreign and Indian lenders,  Mr Vinay Mohan Lal, Energy Secretary, told reporters here after the meeting.When asked about Enron's reluctance to renegotiate, Mr Lal said: "They are  coming again on May 23. What does that mean?"  Though none of those present at the meeting was willing to give more details,  senior State Government officials had earlier told Business Line that the  State would be willing to discuss phase II only after a decision on the  rebate slapped on DPC."Basically our strategy will be to bring the Rs 401- crore rebate payable by  DPC to the centre-stage," the official said."The company has not mentioned a  single word about the rebate in any of their letters to either the MSEB or  the State. And we, on the other hand, have discussed anything but the rebate  in our letters to DPC," he said.Mr Wade Cline, Managing Director, Enron India, did not comment on whether the  company would issue the preliminary termination notice.The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, and  Mr Lal had last evening briefed the Democratic Front constituents about their  stand vis-a-vis Enron.They are understood to have told the political brass of the State that MSEB  does not need the second phase of the Dabhol power project.They categorically said MSEB would not buy power from DPC-phase II, it is  learnt.MSEB also reiterated its stand that DPC should adjust the dues owed by it  against the non-performance penalty.Senior MSEB officials said the board had replied to the arbitration notice  issued by DPC and made its position clear.The board is of the opinion that  DPC should adjust Rs 213 crore - the December and January bills - against the  Rs 401 crore penalty for performance default.The State Government also has backed the MSEB in its replies to the three  arbitration notices served on it.It has said that since MSEB does not accept  the charges - non-compliance with the power purchase agreement (PPA) -  leveled against it, the State is not bound to pay.The Centre too is understood to have backed MSEB in its preliminary reply to  the conciliation notice from DPC.Today's meeting was attended by Mr Cline, Mr Neil McGregor, President, DPC,  Mr Mukesh Tyagi, Vice-President, DPC, and Mr Sanjeev Khandekar, VP, DPC, and  Mr Mohan Gurunath, Chief Financial Officer, DPC.Among the renegotiation panel members, Mr Deepak Parekh, Mr E A S Sarma and  Mr Kirit Parikh were also unable to attend.The next meeting is scheduled on  May 23, Mr Lal said.Gokak nominated to panel: The Government has nominated former fertiliser and  telecom secretary, Mr A.V. Gokak, to the arbitration committee involving  Dabhol Power Company (DPC).The Power Ministry had earlier mooted the additional solicitor general, Mr  Harish Salve's candidature for the job.The conciliation process, however, has been hanging fire as the third  conciliator is yet to be appointed.Dabhol Power Company had written to the  Centre last month seeking six names for selection of a mutually acceptable  conciliator to kick- start the conciliation process.DPC's letter to the Finance Ministry was seen in the context of the  substantial delay between the initiation of the conciliation process three  weeks ago and the finalisation of the conciliators.Soon after the  conciliation process was initiated, DPC decided to invoke political force  majeure and moved in for arbitration - a prelude to termination of the  project.Our Bureau  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.India to allow 3rd party sale if DPC, MSEB jointly approach  05/12/2001 Press Trust of India Limited (c) 2001 PTI Ltd.Mumbai, May 12 (PTI) The Federal Government will allow sale of power to a  "willing buyer" if the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) and  Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) will together approach the power  ministry with a concrete proposal for their 2,184 mw project in Dabhol."I will give whatever status they want, including a mega project one, if DPC  and MSEB jointly approach the Centre (Federal Government) for the same",  Indian Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told reporters here Saturday.He said the Indian Government would extend its cooperation to the Maharashtra  government (western state) "in every way" to resolve the imbroglio between  MSEB and DPC.When pointed out that both the state government and DPC were of the opinion  that federal power utility National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) should  buy the power, Prabhu said NTPC cannot do so as it was power selling entity  and not buying one."There is no question of NTPC buying power from the project since long term  power purchase agreements (PPAs) have been signed by NTPC with the buying  states", he reiterated.Prabhu said the Indian Government would also try and find out potential  buyers of DPC power "if other states were willing to buy the same".Earlier in his meeting with state chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the  latter had suggested that NTPC sell the excess power over and above the  300-400 MW needed for the state from the 740 MW phase-I and soon to be  commissioned phase-II of 1,444 MW, to other needy states.(THROUGH ASIA PULSE) 12-05 2001  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.LOCAL STORIES DEFAZIO CALLS FOR STATE TO BUY PGE TO PROTECT RATES DAVE HOGAN AND JEFF MAPES of the Oregonian Staff  05/12/2001 Portland Oregonian SUNRISE C01 (Copyright (c) The Oregonian 2001)  Summary: The suggestion generates little enthusiasm and critics suspect it's  motivated by the lawmaker's possible race for governor  "I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can  insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business  community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale  markets." -- U.S. REP. PETER DeFAZIO D-ORE.The state of Oregon should consider buying investor-owned Portland General  Electric to help protect Oregonians from gyrations in the electricity market,  U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio declared Friday.Gov. John Kitzhaber reacted politely and said he'll explore the idea, but  others said it's a long shot because of political, financial and timing  factors.Critics said the proposal appeared aimed more at attracting attention to  DeFazio's potential candidacy for governor than anything else.Several companies already are considering buying the utility, but DeFazio  said state ownership could help keep PGE customers' electricity rates low and  generate profits that could help the rest of Oregon."I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can  insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business  community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale  markets," said DeFazio, D-Ore.PGE serves about 725,000 retail customers, mostly in the Portland area, and  is owned by Houston-based Enron Corp.PGE's sale to Nevada's Sierra Pacific  Resources for $3.1 billion officially fell apart last month.Other possible  buyers include Northwest Natural and ScottishPower, which owns PacifiCorp.While Enron and PGE officials declined to comment Friday, legislative leaders  showed no particular enthusiasm for DeFazio's idea."I appreciate his efforts, but I don't think it's the right idea at this  time," said House Speaker Mark Simmons, R-Elgin.He said the state already  has a package of bills aimed at spurring more energy production and  conservation.Senate President Gene Derfler, R-Salem, said he'd be willing to sit down and  talk with DeFazio."I would not just shut the door," he said, but he doesn't  plan to devote much work to the proposal.Derfler questioned whether state  government could run a utility as efficiently as a business.DeFazio said a PGE purchase would offer several benefits.State ownership  would put control of PGE in local hands instead of those of a faraway  corporation such as ScottishPower.For PGE customers, state ownership would  provide some protection and stability in electricity rates.It also would be  a good investment that would pay for itself and perhaps pump revenue back  into the state's coffers.The purchase could be financed with tax-exempt bonds sold by the state.DeFazio said state Treasurer Randall Edwards had told him the idea was "in  the realm of possibility."  DeFazio's idea is an intriguing one and could provide some benefits, said Bob  Jenks, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board, which represents  customers of investor-owned utilities such as PGE.Jenks said the primary benefit would be that, if the state bought PGE, the  utility would be able to buy lower-priced electricity from the Bonneville  Power Administration, which is required to sell power at lower rates to  publicly owned utilities.However, a publicly owned PGE wouldn't be able to  buy the lower-priced BPA power for about five years because of electricity  sales contracts that already are in place.And even if PGE were able to buy lower-priced BPA power, that wouldn't  necessarily translate to lower electricity bills for PGE customers, Jenks  said.In addition, he said it could increase rates for other publicly owned  utilities because the BPA has a shortage of cheap hydropower.The state Public Utility Commission would have to approve any sale of PGE,  but outgoing PUC Chairman Ron Eachus criticized DeFazio's proposal, saying it  had the potential to increase rates both for PGE customers and for publicly  owned utilities.He also said it seemed designed to get political attention  for DeFazio's potential candidacy."I think we're in the political season where people are proposing grandiose  schemes that aren't very well thought out, and this seems to be one of  those," Eachus said.DeFazio conceded that a high-profile proposal focused on a Portland-area  issue such as the ownership of PGE would be a good way for a candidate to  build support for a run for governor, but he said that had nothing to do with  his plan.You can reach Dave Hogan at 503-221-8531 or by e-mail at  davehogan@news.oregonian.com.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Congressman suggests state buy PGE By CHARLES E. BEGGS Associated Press Writer  05/11/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001.The Associated Press.All Rights Reserved.SALEM, Ore. (AP) - Congressman Peter DeFazio on Friday proposed that the  state buy Portland General Electric as a way to hold down power costs.The Democrat outlined his plan after presenting it to Gov. John Kitzhaber,  who said he would ask his energy advisers to analyze it.PGE is Oregon's biggest electric utility, serving more than 700,000  customers.DeFazio said a state purchase of the company could insulate many  Oregonians from "the craziness in power markets."  DeFazio said the state could buy the company by issuing revenue bonds and  have the utility operate as a public power entity.He said the purchase would give the state a diverse mix of transmission  rights along with hydropower, gas, coal and renewable energy sources."While I have not exhaustively researched the proposal, it does appear to be  feasible," said DeFazio, an opponent of electric deregulation.Enron Corp., the Texas-based owner of PGE, is trying to sell the utility.Sierra Pacific last month abandoned its plan to buy PGE for $3.1 billion,  citing increasing difficulties in the current market and the political  environment in the West.Kitzhaber said he's not opposed to the idea of the state buying a private  utility, as long as it would benefit consumers.DeFazio said PGE has been a profitable company, and putting it in public  ownership could give it preference over private utilities for the Bonneville  Power Administration's hydropower.The congressman's suggestion wasn't welcomed by the Legislature."Thanks, but no thanks," said House Speaker Mark Simmons."Philosophically, I think it's the wrong approach," he said."We have a  bipartisan package of bills dealing with the issue."  Among those are his measure to delay partial electric deregulation for large  businesses and a bill to speed up the process for siting temporary generating  plants.Senate President Gene Derfler didn't reject the idea, but said the  Legislature doesn't have enough time in the current session to take on a job  like a utility purchase.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.",0,0,0

NEW YORK -- After more than two years of talks, Saudi Arabia is about to  announce its choice of international oil companies for three huge natural-gas  projects that will mark a reopening of the kingdom's energy sector to Western  investment, a quarter century after it was nationalized.But the announcement, and the signing of memorandums of understanding early  next month, will mark only the beginning of serious negotiations on terms for  the three ventures, which together will need investment of some $25 billion.It will be months before final agreements are signed."We expect to have an agreement -- a final agreement -- signed somewhere at  the end of the year, or, hopefully, the first quarter of next year," said  Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi in an interview last week.Saudi Arabia's 11-member Supreme Petroleum Council is expected to meet today  to endorse the companies recommended by a ministerial committee led by  Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal.In the following week, Saudi Arabia  is expected to communicate its decision to the oil companies from both sides  of the Atlantic that have been vying for a role in the three projects.By the  end of the month, the chosen consortium members and Saudi officials are  expected to agree on which three companies will lead the projects.This will  be a prestigious role in a country that is the world's largest oil exporter,  has more than a quarter of the world's oil reserves and has the fifth-largest  reserves of natural gas.As with any negotiations for such huge projects, industry rumors abound.All  three so-called oil supermajors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch/Shell Group  and BP PLC -- have been mentioned as project leaders, particularly for the  plum Ghawar project, named after the world's largest onshore oil field, whose  environs are expected to yield large volumes of gas.The Ghawar project,  known as Core Venture 1, is projected to require about $15 billion in  investment.Core Venture 2 is on the Red Sea coast.The third project is in  Shaybah, a recently developed oil field in the kingdom's Empty Quarter, a  southeastern region bordering the United Arab Emirates.The companies say they have no idea who will be named to the consortia, or  who the Saudis will choose from a short list of 11 companies -- Exxon Mobil,  Shell, BP, Chevron Corp., TotalFinaElf SA, ENI SpA, Enron Corp., Occidental  Petroleum Corp., Marathon Oil Canada Inc., Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum  Corp. -- to lead each project.But they all have their hopes."We would be very disappointed if we are not the lead operator" for the  Shaybah project, said Archie Dunham, Conoco's chairman and chief executive.Since Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah invited major oil companies to return to  the kingdom in October 1998, negotiations have focused on such broad issues  as the scope of the projects and their integrated nature -- from exploration  and production of gas to the making of petrochemicals and electricity -- as  well as the notion that the companies will need adequate returns on their  investment.Soon, the project leaders will have to start the bargaining on such issues as  the roles to be played by national champions Aramco and petrochemicals  company Saudi Basic Industries Corp.---  Alexei Barrionuevo in Houston contributed to this article.  --- Population Pressure  Saudi Arabia is opening up its energy sector, in a bid to bolster the  economy as population grows  -- Population 21.3 million (growing over 3.5% per year)  -- Unemployment rate* 27%-35% of males  -- Real GDP Growth Rate 7.6%  -- Oil Production 9.3 million barrels per day  -- Natural-Gas Reserves 204.5 trillion cubic feet  -- Natural-Gas Production/Consumption 1.68 trillion cubic feet  *Unofficial estimate for 1999  Note: Figures are estimates for 2000 except natural-gas production, which is for 1999  Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Cheney task force seeks input from interest groups By SHARON THEIMER Associated Press Writer  05/14/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001.The Associated Press.All Rights Reserved.WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House team developing a national energy plan has  met with more than 130 interest groups, from environmentalists and unions  often at odds with Republicans to major Bush supporters given private  sessions with Vice President Dick Cheney.The vice president, Cabinet secretaries and others on a special task force  have solicited ideas behind closed doors, hoping the privacy would encourage  a free exchange of ideas.The White House has declined to provide names of participants - even to  Congress.But interviews with participants detail a massive outreach where diverse  interests have met with task force executive director Andrew Lundquist.Cheney's time has been reserved for meetings with more select participants  such as power wholesaler Enron Corp. and the Edison Electric Institute, both  GOP donors.Houston-based Enron is the world's top buyer and seller of natural gas and  electricity."The way the task force is set up, they don't have the staff or time to have  a huge host of companies come through the door. They have told us to work  through our associations to the extent we can," said Don Duncan, vice  president of government relations for Phillips Petroleum Co.Participants said the meetings, typically 20 minutes to 45 minutes, included  about a dozen to 100 interest group members and a few task force members and  staff.No details were disclosed.Instead, administration representatives summarized  the nation's energy problems or listened as groups briefly offered background  and proposals.Many sent detailed materials to the task force outlining their  priorities.At a half-hour meeting in late March with White House strategist Karl Rove  and Bush economic adviser Larry Lindsey, nuclear energy executives tried to  make sure the two knew about the production records the industry has set over  the past few years.At one point, Rove asked if anyone was looking to build a  nuclear power plant.An executive with Exelon replied that his company was  thinking about it, meeting participants said.Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham has attended several meetings, including one  with Teamsters President James Hoffa and an hourlong session in California  with Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, who contends the administration has done  little to help the power-strapped state.Like other governors, Davis was asked to provide one page on the state's  power crisis, including a description of the problem, an anecdote about it  and possible solutions."They're asking for a one-page memo on possibly the biggest crisis ever  affecting the state, with a massive ripple effect for the nation," Davis  spokesman Steve Maviglio said."I think it demands more attention than a  one-page memo."  Cheney spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said the task force has been  studying the California problem almost daily.At a meeting between Abraham and about 100 coal industry representatives in  late April, task force staffers handed out a briefing packet that outlined  national energy needs, and then they listened to industry proposals."I thought the purpose was one, to reassure people in the coal industry that  coal was going to play a large role in the energy mix, and essentially when  the plan is unveiled that they're going to be looking to people to help  martial this through Congress," said Bill Banig, a lobbyist for the United  Mineworkers Union.White House officials said the meetings are not designed to encourage  lobbying and that task force members were carefully instructed on what was  permissible under federal law.Cheney's meetings included Enron, Edison Electric Institute, California  Republicans, and the senators from Nevada, home to the proposed Yucca  Mountain federal nuclear waste site.The vice president plans to meet with  the renewable-energy industry this week.Enron ranked among Bush's top 10 presidential campaign contributors, giving  more than $110,000, and helped sponsor a $7 million party fund-raiser last  month.The Edison Electric Institute gave Republican candidates more than two-thirds  of its $193,000 in contributions last year.Edison International, whose  holdings include the Southern California Edison electric utility, is also a  major donor, giving $535,000 to Republicans last year and $330,000 to  Democrats.Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said Cheney met with Enron executives because the  power wholesaler is a respected member of the industry, not because it was a  contributor.Enron wants the administration's energy plan to ease electricity  transmission bottlenecks, give companies incentives to invest in new  transmission and make the wholesale power market as open as possible, he  said.Tom Kuhn, the institute's president, said it is "totally ludicrous" to think  political donations played a role.Cheney's meeting with Edison board members, held at the institute's  invitation, lasted 15 minutes to 20 minutes.Cheney spoke about the task  force process, Kuhn said.He said Cheney's remarks were consistent with the  vice president's public statements.Edison wants to see new generation and transmission systems built, including  coal, natural gas and nuclear and hydroelectric power, Kuhn said.Democrats in Congress sought a list of participants in the meetings, but  Cheney's office responded by only listing broad categories and no names.That  has left fodder for political attack."You can't just take advice from one interest group or set of interest groups  when you do these things," said Dave Albersworth of the Wilderness Society,  whose group has met with Lundquist but was denied its request to talk with  Cheney.Weiss countered that the energy task force has collected information from  more than 130 groups since January in an "almost Herculean effort" to draw  input from all sides."People deserve the right to petition their government and not expect a full  laundry list of who's called to be announced," she said.Enron spokesman Palmer said he is not seeking such privacy."I'm happy to  tell people what we're advocating for. I'd rather be talking about policy  than about politics," he said.---  On the Net:  White House Energy Task Force:  http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud10.html  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.COMPANIES & FINANCE UK: Independents drill deep to strike rich seams: A new  generation of smaller oil companies is emerging; a group that has discovered  how to be competitive, writes David Buchan: Financial Times; May 14, 2001 By DAVID BUCHAN  		The UK's listed small oil companies may have dwindled in number.But they can  rightly say, echoing Mark Twain's words, that reports of their collective  demise are exaggerated.Indeed, many in the UK-based exploration and production companies, dubbed  "independents" in the sense of being untied to any refining and marketing,  believe they have more of a role than when their kind first started operating  in the North Sea 30 years ago.After the takeovers in recent years of Lasmo, Monument and British Borneo,  there may only be about a dozen significant UK-based "independents" left.Yet  they amount to virtually the entire European E&P sector: the only significant  exception being Lundin Oil of Sweden.Many of the UK independents began life as local partners of US companies in  the 1970s when the Labour government of the period gave preference to  consortia with a local flavour.But this rationale disappeared when the Thatcher government took a more  free-for-all approach to letting anyone develop the North Sea - though at the  same time it did create the biggest UK independent by floating off British  Gas' oil interests as Enterprise Oil.Enterprise is the only UK independent  that is more than a niche or regional player.As such its E&P assets would be  a significant addition to an oil major, hence the persistently rumoured  interest in taking it over.As the North Sea became more competitive and difficult, some of the UK-based  independents began to look elsewhere."Unlike US independents which have  always tended to be less interested in drilling outside North America, those  in the UK have always tended to be more sympathetic to exotic parts of the  world", says Mark Redway of Teather and Greenwood.Unfortunately, the obvious exotic new province that happened to open up in  the early 1990s was the former Soviet Union.One company, Ramco Energy,  dipped in and out very successfully, recently selling its 2 per cent stake in  the Azerbaijan International Oil Consortium for Dollars 150m (Pounds 104.8m).Other UK independents - Aminex, Soco and Dana Petroleum - ventured into  Russia and got stuck.While Aminex finds it hard to downplay Russia (because  it has little elsewhere), Soco these days stresses its Mongolia and Vietnam  operations.Another UK independent, JKX Oil & Gas, went into Ukraine, a  country notorious for non-payment of energy bills.With diplomatic help from  Tony Blair, the prime minister, JKX has just survived a legal attempt to rob  it of its Ukraine assets.Two other independents have sunk more fruitful roots in Asia."Cairn Energy  now has as big a stake in Bangladesh's gas production as Shell, and it would  be left, if Enron (the US energy company) were to quit India, as the biggest  foreign player in India," says Iain Reid of UBS Warburg.Premier Oil is now a  substantial Asian gas company, with production in Burma, Indonesia and  Pakistan and long term contracts in Thailand and Singapore.But there are risks in these Asian ties.The obvious political one concerns  Burma.Last year the UK government asked Premier to quit Burma because its  presence was helping the military regime.Premier refused, and said it would  carry on.The other risk, according to Mr Redway, is economic and it applies also to  Cairn.Because there is no real world market for gas, Cairn and Premier are  "very dependent on the strength of the local economies".But then, Mr Redway  is an analyst who believes that independents' competitive edge lies in  exploration rather than production.He therefore rates Fusion Oil & Gas  highly as "the purest exploration investment opportunity in the E&P sector".Dana similarly vaunts its exploration expertise, but to a different end.Its  goal, according to Tom Cross, chief executive, is to find oil and then swap  exploration for production assets."This avoids the expensive development  stage of building platforms and pipelines and so on".Then at the other end  of the spectrum are production-focused companies, such as Paladin, Tullow Oil  or Venture Production.Roy Franklin, Paladin's chief executive, makes no  bones about his company's scavenger strategy, spotting rich pickings  overlooked by the majors.The majors are not always ready to sell, particularly recently when the oil  price rise has widened the gap in price expectations between buyers and  sellers.But Paladin was last year able to buy PetroCanada's assets in Norway, and is  this year interested in bidding for some of what the Norwegian state is  selling off.As its name suggests, Venture Production, a private Aberdeen-based company  with North Sea and Trinidad operations, is focused on extraction, not  exploration.And so are other private companies such as Intrepid, Consort  Energy and Highland Energy, formed in the past three or four years.This new  generation of company tends to be more cautious than the older one."Exploration has probably been the best way to destroy shareholder value,"  says one executive.The other risk the new oilmen want to avoid is the vagaries of the stock  market."By focusing on production, the new companies are more predictable in  terms of cash flow and earnings," says Mike Wagstaff, Venture's finance  director.Copyright: The Financial Times Limited  		 		    News Bush energy team covers all the bases Sharon Theimer, Associated Press  05/14/2001 Chicago Tribune North Sports Final ; N 13 (Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune)  The White House team developing a national energy plan has met with more than  130 interest groups, from environmentalists and unions often at odds with  Republicans to major Bush supporters.Vice President Dick Cheney, Cabinet secretaries and others have solicited  ideas behind closed doors, hoping the privacy would encourage a free exchange  of ideas.The White House has declined to provide names of participants even to  Congress.But interviews with participants detail an outreach program where diverse  interests have met with task force executive director Andrew Lundquist.Cheney's time has been reserved for meetings with more select participants  such as power wholesaler Enron Corp. and the Edison Electric Institute, both  GOP donors."The way the task force is set up, they don't have the staff or time to have  a huge host of companies come through the door.

Qatar and DEL in March signed a "commercial term sheet agreement" which  outlined the conditions of the upstream agreement for the long-awaited $3.5  billion project.UOG currently owns 51 percent of DEL, with the remainder held equally by  France's TotalFinaElf and Enron."Enron is going through major global restructuring," Mubarak said."(But)  they haven't officially notified us about their intention to pull out."  Enron officials declined comment.Mubarak said interest in DEL was running high."Everyone is asking for a stake," he said.The gas deal would entitle DEL to develop a tract of Qatar's giant North  Field and produce up to two billion cubic feet per day (cfd) of gas.UOG is to invest $2 billion in developing the North Field tract, drilling and  setting up production facilities.The remaining $1.5 billion would be invested to lay a pipeline and set up  receiving terminals at Dubai's Jebel Ali and Taweelah in Abu Dhabi.First gas is targeted to reach the UAE capital Abu Dhabi by late 2004 or  early 2005.About one billion to 1.5 billion cfd of Qatari gas would be  consumed by utilities in Abu Dhabi with the remainder supplied to Dubai.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.UAE: UPDATE 1-Saudi expected to name gas race winners on Tuesday.By Peg Mackey  05/14/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.DUBAI, May 14 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is  expected to meet on Tuesday and announce the oil majors chosen for its  multi-billion dollar gas investment opening, industry sources familiar with  the negotiations said on Monday.The sources said the SPC is expected to name ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell  as lead players in three so-called core projects involving the kingdom's  upstream gas sector - off-limits to foreign oil firms since nationalisation  in 1975.Signing of memoranda of understanding (MOUs) would most probably take place  in early June, the sources said.The anticipated announcement would mark the biggest advance in the kingdom's  gas initiative, valued at an initial $25 billion, since Riyadh unveiled its  energy investment opening over two years ago.But the hard work has yet to start on the opening of Saudi Arabia's gas  sector, the world's fourth biggest."The fiscal regime and regulatory details  have not been developed," said one source.FINAL CUT  Riyadh is expected to trim back its original shortlist of 11 potential  foreign investors revealed last summer.Those companies had been grouped  under three core venture consortia - South Ghawar, Red Sea and Shaybah.For ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell, securing the lead role in Saudi  Arabia's core ventures would entitle them to operate the package and get the  biggest slice of the projects, analysts said.Other industry sources said ExxonMobil, the world's biggest energy company,  was tipped for the top slot in core venture 1 (South Ghawar) as well as in  core venture 2 (Red Sea).Royal Dutch/Shell was in pole position for core venture 3 (Shaybah), the  sources added.Both oil supermajors already have significant foreign investment in the  kingdom and feature as top customers of Saudi oil, the analysts said.ENERGY DRIVERS  An urgent need to create jobs and grow the economy are driving Saudi Arabia's  landmark energy opening.And analysts said big oil companies were prepared to help the kingdom achieve  those aims even if the return on their investment was relatively low."Major oil companies just cannot miss this opportunity," a source said."The  gas projects will show profits."  But just how much revenue oil companies will generate by selling water and  electricity in the Saudi domestic market remains to be seen.On paper, at least, the kingdom's domestic gas sector looks set for  impressive growth.Domestic gas demand, now running at about 3.4 billion cubic feet per day, is  forecast to grow at more than seven percent a year over the coming decade.Saudi Arabia has meanwhile made clear that its prized oil sector, the world's  biggest, remains off limits.Even so, oil companies still hold out hope for eventual involvement in oil,  the kingdom's lifeblood."The companies are just as happy with gas, but oil remains the ultimate  objective," a regional analyst said."Saudi Aramco is still putting up strong defence barriers, but eventually  they could open up the oil sector once they feel comfortable working with the  majors."  The Saudi gas initiative seeks foreign oil companies' help in developing the  kingdom's known gas reserves as well as investment in downstream projects fed  by gas supplies, such as power and desalination.The following companies have been shortlisted for the gas projects:  Core venture 1 (South Ghawar Area) - ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP ,  TotalFinaElf , Chevron and ENI .Core venture 2 (Red Sea Area) - TotalFinaElf, ExxonMobil, Marathon , Enron /Oxy , Conoco , Royal Dutch/Shell.Core venture 3 (Shaybah Area) - Royal Dutch/Shell, ExxonMobil, Marathon,  Conoco, TotalFinaElf, Phillips and Enron/Oxy.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Saudi Oil Council To Meet Tue On Gas Projects -Sources  05/14/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- International oil companies vying for a stake in Saudi  Arabia's downstream gas projects, expect to be notified soon on whether they  have been selected to participate, industry sources in the kingdom said  Monday.Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council is set to meet Tuesday and shortly  after, announce its final selection for each of the three core ventures on  offer, the sources said.The Saudi Arabian committee negotiating with international oil companies on  the Gas Initiative, submitted its proposals for consortium members and  leaders to the country's Ministerial Council in April.These were then passed  on to the SPC for final approval.Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah, who heads the SPC, is in Bahrain Monday  attending a Gulf Cooperation Council leaders' summit along with Saudi  Arabia's foreign minister, Saud Al Faisal, who heads the gas negotiating  committee.Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to  participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas  enhancement.After a series of meetings between the negotiating committee and IOC's in the  past year, the following companies were shortlisted for each project.Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron  Corp. (CHV), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and ENI SpA (E) for Core Venture 1,  the $15 billion South Ghawar Area Development.For Core Venture 2, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental  Petroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and Exxon Mobil, Total Fina Elf,  Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) were listed.And for Core Venture 3, the Shaybah area, Total Fina Elf, Conoco, Phillips  Petroleum (P), Enron and Occidental, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Marathon Oil were  listed.With all those shortlisted expected to play some role, the immediate and  essential question for each of the IOC's is whether they will be selected to  lead and operate a project, with Core Venture 1 the most sought after,  industry sources said.Exxon Mobil and Shell have been tipped as frontrunners for this venture.The operator's role will be more crucial than ever here as it will be  responsible for directing further negotiations on the projects at hand which  will lead to final deals probably by year end.Also, operators are expected to decide and direct how the project's  individual and large components will be developed, details the Saudis haven't  finalized, sources said.The three ventures have been estimated at a combined value of about $25  billion.-By Dyala Sabbagh, Dow Jones Newswires; 9714-331-4260;  dyala.sabbagh@dowjones.com  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Business RFID chip will help speed up business  05/14/2001 The New Straits Times Main/Lifestyle; 2* 26 (Copyright 2001)  THE combination of recently developed "stick-on" Radio Frequency  Identification (RFID) chip technology with a global positioning system (GSP)  will transform and quicken the pace of doing business in the oil and gas  industry.And Malaysia must adapt to this shift to maintain her global positioning.Global management and technology consultant Global Energy Strategy Practice  which is working in partnership with Accenture Sdn Bhd wants to promote this  idea locally.Global Energy Strategy Practice partner Paul Spence said that applying this  latest combined technology, car owners can fill up a petrol tank without  resorting to human contact or to the use of a credit card.Relevant personal data embedded in the RFID chip would be machine read and  the required quantity of petrol delivered, as if right out of a science  fiction movie.This surreal development is made possible through the application of  ubiquitous-commerce (u-commerce) whereby computers and machines communicate  with each other to affect an impression of an omnipresent intelligence.Such technology is economically available today."There are technology  suppliers who are offering these capabilities."  The technology also has applications outside the oil and gas industry.Communications between machines can now allow or deny access of individuals  to restricted zones.In an interview in Petaling Jaya recently, Spence said: "A lot of my clients  now are asking, whether that same technology can be used to restrict access  into hazardous areas, plants or production sites.  "Can a warning alarm be fitted to the individual or to an assistant?There  are lots of safety, health and environment applications around that."  "Guru in the field" is another potential application where a combination of  RFID chips, video cameras, personal digital assistants (PDA) and personal  computers can deliver distant technical advice on- site.  "An industry client operating in the North Sea oil fields has a prototype  mounted on a workman's helmet which sends snap-shots to experts on the other  side of the world."The effect of this new combined technology on global financial and commodity  markets is to lock them in tighter correlation.  "The days of being able to arbitrage for profits between geographical markets  are shortening within the energy industry.Enron which is the biggest oil  trader in the US is now hedging on weather derivatives."  Accenture partner Lim Beng Choon said that to compete globally, the oil and  gas industry in Malaysia would have to implement this new technology to  remain connected to global markets.

India: Godbole panel report may suggest MSEB bifurcation  05/14/2001 Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) -  Asia Intelligence Wire  MUMBAI, May 13. THE second part of the Dr Madhav Godbole committee report is  expected to be submitted to the State Government on May 15.  While the first part of the report recommended renegotiation of the power  purchase agreement with Enron's Dabhol Power Company, the second part is  expected to suggest bifurcation of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board,  sources said. The committee, which has been given the mandate to negotiate  with Enron officials to make DPC power more acceptable, had a marathon  meeting on May 11 to finalise the second half of the report. "The committee has been considering the bifurcation of MSEB," a source said.  "The idea is to try and separate the distribution from generation and  transmission." While generation and transmission can be controlled by the  State, there may be a suggestion to privatise the distribution arm. Over 1.5  lakh MSEB employees had gone on a strike to oppose a Bill to unbundle the  board into three divisions - generation, transmission and distribution - due  to fear of privatisation.  MSEB, the State's leading power company, has been facing huge losses due to  delay in payments and theft of power. The second part of the report is  expected to address the problem in detail.  Part one of the report submitted on April 10 had said: "...none of the  solutions espoused for independent power producers, in general, and DPC, in  particular, is tenable without the reforms of MSEB, especially its  distribution business, which it shall address in part II of the report."  The report is expected to "suggest appropriate measures to ensure that the  interests of the State, MSEB and electricity consumers of the State of  Maharashtra are properly and adequately considered, evaluated and  safeguarded," according to the terms of reference laid down when forming the  committee.  The committee originally consisted of Dr Madhav Godbole, Mr Deepak Parekh, Dr  E.A.S. Sarma, Dr Rajendra Pachauri and the State Energy Secretary, Mr Vinay  Mohan Lal. The MSEB Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, has been inducted as part of  the panel after the submission of the first part and before the beginning of  negotiations with Enron.  Archana Chaudhary  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    The Smart Investor Tertiary will be primary Indira Vergis  05/14/2001 Business Standard 2 Copyright (c) Business Standard  These are volatile times for world business. There are increasing jitters  that a slowing US economy could dampen prospects for the global economies.  Many developing regions, especially in Asia, are bracing themselves for a  bout of slightly lower growth.  But two countries, India and China which together account for about half the  region's gross domestic product (GDP_ will still continue to see their GDP  grow at six per cent, forecasts the Asian Development Bank. Many Indian economists agree with ADB's projections. In fact, they view the  prediction of a six per cent growth in India's GDP as benign. Nearly 54 per  cent of India's GDP is delivered by its services sector and a modest  performance by this sector, some economists say, will be enough to hold up  the GDP at six per cent. There are others who hope that better agricultural  performance could prompt the economy to hand in a better scorecard.  However, the Indian industry remains trapped in the doldrums, suffering from  a lack of consumer confidence and investments. Very few economists expect to  see signs of recovery sprouting any time soon.  An interest rate cut is considered vital by many to energise the sector. And,  they argue, there are certain economic indicators that encourage such a move.  Inflation is running at very low levels and the nation's foreign exchange  reserves are currently high enough to provide a strong defence to the Indian  currency. Surprisingly, our trade balance, which threatened to spiral out of  control by surging oil prices last year, has been contained. Since then, oil  prices have retreated and are expected to remain subdued. While a rate cut  may go some way in reviving sentiment and activity in the industrial sector,  stirring up consumer demand will still hinge on a normal monsoon.  Rain, rain, come again  For many economists, the prediction of India clinging to its current GDP  level is heavily contingent on a normal spell of monsoon this year.  "According to our assessment, we believe the Indian economy will grow by  around 6.5 per cent this fiscal year," says Chetan Ahya, vice president at J  M Morgan Stanley Securities.  In 2000-01, agricultural growth withered under a poor monsoon and a  subsequent drought in many parts of the country. For the second year in a  row, growth in the sector sank below one per cent. It stood at 0.9 per cent  compared with 0.7 per cent the previous year. While agriculture accounts for  only 24 per cent of GDP, it remains the most keenly-watched sector by  economists. "The performance of the agricultural sector is important because  of its linkages to the economy both on the supply side and on the consumption  side," says Mohan Nagarajan, chief economist at Credit Analysis and Research  Ltd (CARE). "It would lead to a better performance of agro-based industries,"  he adds.  More significantly, roughly 60 per cent of Indians still depend on  agriculture for their livelihood. "A good crop means that demand for  everything, from everyday use goods like toothpaste to larger items like  tractors will pick up," says Nagarajan. Economists are hoping that a good  monsoon will budge growth in the sector to around 1.5 to 2.5 per cent.  In service of the economy  Another key sector economists will be watching out for will be services.  India's services sector ranging from finance, insurance, hospitality to  transportation and communication slowed its pace in 2000-01. With growth  weakening by a whole per cent to 8.4 in 2000-01, sluggishness in this  important sector has been blamed for dragging down the overall GDP. Most  economists expect the sector to post either relatively flat growth or edge  slightly higher this year. But, it's performance will be vital to ensure that  overall GDP holds at six per cent. "Even if the agriculture and industry  numbers fall again but services sees even seven to eight per cent growth, it  will be enough to keep the GDP around six per cent," says Nagarajan.  Construction activity a services component that includes housing, roads and  other infrastructure projects demonstrated surprisingly good growth of 8.7  per cent and is expected to maintain the pace. Road construction is tipped to  show increasing levels of activity as work on the ambitious highway linking  Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Calcutta intensifies.  Chiming in will be the housing industry, benefiting in recent years from tax  reliefs and attractive financing schemes, and which have encouraged more  people to buy houses.  Another segment slated to witness good growth will be IT-enabled services,  says Morgan Stanley's Ahya. "We are emerging as the services workshop of the  world," he says. IT-enabled services like call centres and data processing,  though currently generating tiny revenues, are slated to turn into big money  spinners in the years ahead.  The telecommunications industry will also see improving levels of investment.  "The penetration of services is so low, that it has an intrinsic high growth  rate," says Ahya. For a taste of the market, consider this: out of the 100  Indians, only one uses the Internet and less than three own a telephone.  A good home show  And there could be a pleasant surprise in store for industry amid all the  gloom over its performance.  Adequate liquidity conditions are spurring expectations of a cut in interest  rates. Broad money(M3) a gauge of total money available in the economy  increased 16.2 per cent in 2000-01 against 14.6 per cent last year.  While the Reserve Bank of India had cut the bank rate in March, the belief is  that a further cut of 50 basis points is imminent. The bank rate the rate at  which the central bank lends to commercial banks currently stands at seven  per cent. Aiding the cause is the inflation data which shows the wholesale  price index at a tame 5.84 per cent. With economists betting that oil prices  will remain in the $24-28 a barrel range, inflation is not expected to  exhibit the oil price-inspired gyrations of last year. A cut could coax the  industry to step up activity, though admittedly, much would still depend on  rural demand.  Neighbours' envy  And while many Asian countries watch with increasing nervousness the impact  of an American downturn on their economies, India and China can afford to  remain relatively placid about global developments. That's because they are  less dependent on the US for their own economic health. That is expected to  shield them somewhat from being blown off-course like some other Asian  nations by the ill-wind of an American slump in demand.  With exports making up less than 10 per cent of India's GDP, its economy is  clearly not export-driven. In contrast, nearly 35 per cent of Indonesia's GDP  comes from exports, 57 per cent for Thailand, and 50 per cent for the  Philippines.  Yet, despite claiming only a small percentage of GDP, India's exports  remained a bright spot amid some gloomy economic data. Exports raced ahead 20  per cent to $44.1 billion in 2000-01. It was the second consecutive year of  good exports growth. On the flip side, imports rose, too, during the same  period to Rs $49.1 billion. But non-oil imports, however, declined 15 per  cent to $34.2 billion. That helped narrow the trade gap to $5.74 billion from  $12.79 billion the previous year.  Still, India can ill-afford to ignore completely the risks of an American  slump in demand. The US is India's largest trading partner and, in 2000-01, a  quarter of its exports headed to that nation. Besides, by taking in nearly 70  per cent of India's software exports, it is also India's most important  software exports destination.  Booming software exports accompanied by remittances by Indians living  overseas have been the primary factors exerting a calming influence on  India's balance of payments of position, especially in times of economic  turbulence. For example, last year, while a surging oil import bill  threatened to rattle the nation's trade gap, inflows from  invisibles(including income from software and Indians living abroad) came to  the rescue helping India limit its overall current account deficit.  It's a sobering realisation that has compelled the National Association of  Software and Service Companies(NASSCOM) to lower its exports forecast to  between $8.5 billion to $9 billion from its previous figure of $9.5 billion.  Earlier, it had also revised estimates for 2000-01 lower to $6.2 billion from  $6.3 billion. Still, observers say it isn't a cause for depression.  "They are still talking about growth.It is a decline in the growth rate and  not an actual downturn itself," points out John Band, chief executive  officer, ASK-Raymond James and Associates. And remittances look set to  maintain their pace as well. "Most remittances are still from Indians who  live in the Middle East, and I don't see any slowdown from this segment,"  says CARE's Nagarajan. Remittances totalled $9.8 billion in the nine months  to December 2000. Software exports brought in $4.6 billion during the same  period.  Foreign institutions support  Another recent 'feel-good' sign has been evident in the stock markets too.  Between January and April 2001, eigners poured in Rs 7,368 crore into India's  equity markets - a phenomenal 15 per cent more than what they invested in the  whole of calendar 2000.  Yet, experts aren't reading too much into it. In the past few months,  investors have been fleeing from a shower of profit warnings in the US and  seeking cover in alternative investments. As they rejuggle their portfolios,  some money will inevitably flow into India and other countries, experts say.  Because it isn't affected so much by what's happening externally, they see  India as some kind of a safe haven," says ASK's Band.Yet some hesitation  Recently, gunning for more foreign direct investments (FDI), the government  opened more sectors for foreign and private participation, including  pharmaceuticals, hotels, banking and astonishingly, even defence.However,  tempting FDI has always been a vexing issue for India.In 2000-01, FDI did improve slightly, moving 26 per cent higher than the  previous year to $2.4 billion.Yet, China a market India is frequently  compared with in terms of size and potential attracted 20 times more FDI in  the same period.Economists now shrug off FDI as a tool to kick-start  investment in the country."It's a pittance and it probably will remain  stagnant," says an economist at a foreign research house.The reasons are not hard to find.Foreigners seeking to invest in India have  many fences to cross.Frequent changes in sector policies, chaotic  infrastructure facilities and nightmarish bureaucratic redtape have often  left foreigners tired and wary of doing business in India.The stress of investing in India is most clearly visible in the recurring  concerns that have stubbornly dogged US energy giant Enron's 2,148 MW power  project in Dabhol in Maharashtra.After being forced to renegotiate a power  supply deal in 1995 after concluding it in 1992, Enron has hit the headlines  once again.This time, an almost bankrupt state electricity board (SEB) refuses to pay  its dues for power received and the state government refuses to honour its  commitment to pay in case the SEB defaults.It's led to intense speculation  that, after suffering repeated snags for nearly a decade, Enron might simply  pull out of the project altogether.A disturbing turn of events, since, till  recently, Enron Corp was the biggest foreign investor in India.It will not be the first time that exasperation will have egged on a foreign  investor to pull out of a project.Earlier, US-based Cogentrix Energy had  also walked out of its $1.5 billion 1,000 MW Mangalore power project citing  endless bureaucratic hurdles.And there has also been some disappointment over India's much-hyped 300  million middle class which was supposed to be growing rapidly.Many  international firms, inspired by this figure, had scrambled to set up  operations to conquer a huge chunk of this market.Now many are struggling to  break even and still learning to adapt to local tastes a key ingredient for  success.That's why despite all its attempts to open up various sectors,  India still remains a tough sell.Outlook  With a little help from the rains, India could notch up a growth rate of six  per cent.Many economists have also pointed out that a reforms-studded budget  could also inject some enthusiasm in the patient that is the economy.Strong  measures include plans to reform labour laws and government employment.These  are expected to boost the economy's development, though in the long run.The recent opening up of various sectors could also revive sentiment,  although whether this will translate into FDI flows is arguable.Still, every  bit helps.The fact remains that it will have to persist in trying to  accelerate the pace of growth if its ambitions of turning into an economic  powerhouse are to be realised.After all, for the second most populous nation  in the world with one of the biggest markets, its economic power is still  nowhere near the figure its size suggests.Acegas shares, potential for growth (Acegas, le potenzialita di crescita del  titolo)  05/14/2001 La Repubblica 41 Copyright (C) 2001 Abstracted from La Repubblica in Italian; Source: World  Reporter (TM)  Italian brokers Rasfin SIM have indicated the potential for growth in the  shares of Acegas, the former municipal utility of the Italian city of  Trieste.Acegas closed the first quarter of this year with turnover of L137bn  (+45 per cent).Results attributed in part to the start of production of  Estenergy, a consortium of the utilities of Udine, Trieste, Gorizia and Enron  of the US, which supplies energy and services to parts of Friuli.Also significant, according to Rasfin, were investments over the period,  which totalled L43bn.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.A Section IN THE LOOP Al Kamen Roundabout to the Oval Office Al Kamen  05/14/2001 The Washington Post FINAL A19 Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co.All Rights Reserved  Sometimes even Cabinet officers can lose their way in the White House.So  there was Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson, clearly lost  Friday at a fork in a corridor near White House spokesman Ari Fleischer's  office."How do you get to the Oval Office?" he asked a group of reporters and was  directed to the right door, according to a wire report.Fleischer, though, told reporters that was the wrong answer."How do you get to the Oval Office? First you win the Iowa caucus, then you  lose the New Hampshire primary, then you make a comeback in South Carolina,"  he quipped as he recalled President Bush's early primary campaign last year.Passport, Please  Meanwhile, folks at Thompson's HHS may be taking to calling him "Tightwad  Tommy."Seems a memo went out March 15 undermining Alaska and Hawaii's claims  to be part of the United States.Employees "must clear . . . international travel" with the office of the  deputy chief of staff for operations, said the memo from the deputy chief, Ed  Sontag.To clarify, "HHS employees seeking to travel outside the continental  U.S." for meetings and conferences, must get permission and then file trip  reports within two weeks.This sent officials calling around, asking whether trips to those states were  to go through the international travel approval system just as if they were  going to Russia or the Congo.Apparently so.The edict would appear to include even the nearby Virgin  Islands and practically next-door Puerto Rico as well.Loop Fans can only  hope this outrage doesn't spread to other agencies.It would make for some  cold winters.Chewing Out on the Bush Beat  Speaking of Fleischer, the usually affable spokesman is not reluctant to get  tough with reporters when he believes they've stepped out of line.Sheriff Fleischer was on duty Thursday and upset with Houston Chronicle  reporter Bennett Roth.Bush that morning urged parents to talk more to their  kids about the dangers of drugs.Roth, at Fleischer's daily briefing, asked: "Ari, the president talked about  parental involvement today. How much has he talked to his own daughters about  both drugs and drinking? And given the fact that his own daughter was cited  for underage drinking, isn't that a sign that there's only so much effect  that a parent can have on their children's behavior?"  Fleischer responded brusquely: "No, I think, frankly, there are some issues  where I think it's very important for you all in the press corps to recognize  that he is the president of the United States; he's also a father. And the  press corps has been very respectful in the past of treating family matters  with privacy, and I'm certain that you're going to do so again. I hope so."  Fleischer later called Roth to chastise him, telling him his question had  been "noted in the building."  Competing to Oversee the Corps  Former Mississippi representative Mike Parker, a Democrat-turned-Republican  who lost a gubernatorial bid a couple of years back, had been seen as the  pick to be assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, overseeing the  Army Corps of Engineers.Parker, a former undertaker, had support from the barge industry, the various  corps constituencies and fellow Mississippian Trent Lott, the majority leader  of the Senate.But the Pentagon's choice was Lawrence Izzo, recently retired president of  Enron Engineering and Construction Co. who has been in the mix for several  jobs.Izzo, a West Point grad, had 23 years at the Corps before going to  Enron, former home of Army secretary-designate Thomas White.The majority leader was said to be most unhappy.The latest word is Parker's  getting the job.Ex-Reporters Move On  Kenneth J.

Coalpower acquired the Hatfield coal mine on Monday, beating off competition from U.S. energy group Enron and UK Coal (formerly RJB Mining) and is spending about five million pounds ($8.4 million) to restart production.Budge said Hatfield has the potential to become a long-life pit with its 100 million tonnes of contiguous coal reserves and he is looking for output in excess of 500,000 tonnes a year."Hatfield is the optimum site for a coal gasification combined cycle plant", said Budge, adding Britain needed coal generation to maintain a balanced and diverse energy portfolio.The government has said it is concerned about Britain's projected dependence on imported natural gas.Conventional coal burning power stations are high in fossil fuel emissions, which many scientists believe contribute to global warming.But gasification combined cycle technology converts coal to a gaseous fuel from which most of the impurities are removed prior to combustion.Supporters of coal say the clean coal technology can address many of the environmental concerns of burning coal.Coal mining in Britain has been in decline for decades, but the fuel still accounts for about a third of its power generation and recent signs point to the industry enjoying a mini revival.A doubling in the price of British natural gas over the last year has led to a rise in coal demand as electricity generators seek out the cheapest fuel in a highly competitive market.The increased demand for coal has propelled prices to about 35 pounds a tonne compared with 22.50 #18 months ago.Copyright ?2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Enron's Azurix faces damages claim if rescinds Buenos Aires water contract  10/12/2001 AFX News (c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd  BUENOS AIRES (AFX) - Enron Corp water and sewage unit Azurix Buenos Aires SA faces a claim for compensation unless it reverses plans to rescind its concession to provide the province's water and sewage services, financial daily Buenos Aires Economico reported.The damages claim would be filed by public prosecutor Ricardo Szelagowski, the newspaper cited provincial secretary for public services, Eduardo Sicaro, as saying.Azurix said earlier this week it will rescind the concession on Jan 2, but continue operating the service "until the provincial authorities, or the operator it designates, take charge of assets and operations".jms For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com  Copyright ?2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Enron backs away from Coburg plant  10/12/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001.The Associated Press.All Rights Reserved.COBURG, Ore. (AP) - Enron will not be a partner in a proposed natural gas power plant here, the project's managing director said Thursday.But Gary Marcus, who owns Coburg Power, said losing the Texas-based conglomerate will not stop the project."Enron never drove this deal," he said."I invited Enron into the deal."  Marcus said Enron's participation improved the quality of the plant's design but slowed the decision-making process.Marcus predicted he will find a new backer in less than six months and will have a license to build the project within a year.Enron backed out because the project did not meet its market strategy, Marcus said.Enron officials couldn't be reached for comment.Enron's departure will do little to appease local residents, who fear that the power plant will harm ground water and air quality."I don't think it'll ever be built," said Kent Johnston of Coburg, a project opponent."If the people of Coburg and Eugene have anything to say about it, it won't be."  Added Joey Gayles, a committee chairman in the residents' opposition group, "We're going to fight (Marcus) tooth and nail."  The proposed 40-acre site north of Coburg meets all criteria for construction of a 300-megawatt plant on 12 acres of the site, Marcus said.The remainder of the site would be used for buffer area and wetlands mitigation.An additional eight acres will be required for the 600-megawatt plant that Coburg Power wants to build, he said.The larger plant would require additional permits that might delay the project.Expanding the existing natural gas pipeline that runs under the site also would add to the plant's cost.The larger plant would generate the equivalent of all power currently consumed in Lane County.Marcus estimated the cost of the larger plant at $300 million to $400 million.The smaller plant would cost about $180 million, he said.Copyright ?2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.UK Crt Blocks Challenge To Intl Arbitration In Enron Spat  10/12/2001 Dow Jones International News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- The Commercial Court of London has restrained India's Maharashtra state government from filing a suit in India challenging the international arbitration proceedings initiated by Dabhol Power Co., reports the Hindu Business Line.Dabhol Power is an Indian unit of U.S.-based energy company Enron Corp. (ENE).The newspaper says Dabhol obtained the court order Thursday, and the state government has 23 days to respond.Dabhol is locked in a long-standing payment dispute with its sole buyer, Maharashtra State Electricity Board.Dabhol is a 2,184-megawatt power project located in the western Indian state of Maharashtra.Enron holds a controlling 65% stake in Dabhol.Costing $2.9 billion, the project is the single largest foreign investment in India to date.Newspaper Web site: www.thehindubusinessline.com   -By Himendra Kumar; Dow Jones Newswires; 91-11-461-9426; himendra.kumar@dowjones.com  Copyright ?2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.India: Enron may seek $30 m to exit Greenfield  10/12/2001 Business Line (The Hindu) Fin.Times Info Ltd-Asia Africa Intel Wire.Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd.All Rights Res'd  NEW DELHI, Oct. 11 ENRON is looking at a price of about $30 million for exiting from Greenfield Shipping Company, in which one of its affiliates, Atlantic Commercial Inc, is a 20 per cent equity partner.While Enron's 20 per cent stake in the $220-million LNG venture for Dabhol Power Company comes to $11 million, the Houston-based company is understood to have put up a price of $30 million for exiting from Greenfield, bankers familiar with the developments told Business Line.The $30 million price pegged by Enron for its 20 per cent stake comprises $11 million for equity and $19 million for swapping the company's share of the loan liabilities, the sources said.Though Atlantic Commercial Inc is yet to make an official statement on pulling out of the LNG shipping deal, it is understood to have conveyed to the project lenders led by ANZ Investment Bank that such a decision was imminent in view of Enron's plan to exit from Dabhol Power Company.The State-run Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) is a 20 per cent partner in Greenfield, while the remaining 60 per cent equity in the joint venture consortium is held by Japan's Mitsui O.S.K.Lines.In view of the controversy surrounding the power plant, the lenders to the LNG shipping deal have declared an event of default and suspended the last tranche of the project loan worth $55 million.The ANZ Investment Bank-led consortium has already pumped in $110 million out of a total loan commitment of $165 million for the 137,000 cubic metre capacity tanker being build at Mitsubishi's yard in Japan.The three promoters will now have to put in additional investments to the tune of $55 million to take possession of the vessel on the scheduled delivery date of November 15.The board of SCI has not been able to come to a conclusion on putting in extra funds in the project despite discussing the issue several times.A board meet held on Tuesday to discuss the issue again ended in stalemate, Government sources said.SCI's dilemma on making extra investments in the project also centre around the fate of Enron's equity in the deal.In the event of Enron pulling out of the LNG shipping project, its 20 per cent equity would have to be taken over by the two remaining partners.Besides, these two partners would also have to pool-in the additional investments of $55 million amongst themselves in proportion to their revised equity holdings."However, there is a great question mark over whether Mitsui and SCI should agree to take over the equity of Enron", the sources said.During discussions held in London recently, Mitsui had clearly told the lenders that it was not in favour of putting in extra funds to salvage the LNG shipping deal.Moreover, with the consortium now looking at a charter hire rate of $60,000 to $65,000 per day as against the rate of $98,600 per day agreed with Dabhol Power Company, both SCI and Mitsui feels that the revised charter hire rates would render their investments unviable.According to estimates, at a charter hire rate of $60,000 per day, Greenfield is expected to earn about $22 million per annum.Out of this, $4-$5 million will be spent on operating expenses of the tanker.The remaining $17-18 million will fetch an internal rate of return (IRR) of 7-8 per cent for Mitsui at an equity stake of 60 per cent."Mitsui feels that an IRR of this level was not sufficient for their investments", the sources said.Whereas, for SCI, the investments would fetch a return of 4-4.5 per cent."This will be far below the Government norm of 12 per cent IRR for projects involving State-funding," the sources said.P.

This has no bearing on the on-going proceedings involving DPC, MSEB and MERC before the Mumbai High Court and Supreme Court".He also said Maharashtra is not a party to any of the on-going proceedings before the Mumbai High Court and the Supreme Court."Over the past few months, the State Government and other Government entities have taken actions to avoid complying with their contractual obligations.  This has frustrated the rights of international investors that were legally agreed to by the relevant parties several years ago.

The Wall Street Journal Online  Stocks rallied sharply Monday despite the widening anthrax scare, as a batch of better-than-expected quarterly earnings reports cheered investors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 172.92, or 1.9%, to close at 9377.03 after gaining 40.89 points Friday.The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 36.75, or 2.2%, to 1708.06 after climbing 18.59 points in the previous session.Other major stock indexes gained ground Monday.The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 16.42 to 1089.90, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 7.13 to 561.45, and the Russell 2000 Index gained 4.80 to 430.50.Bonds were mixed and the dollar strengthened.The stock market's gains were tempered briefly by news that a postal worker in Washington, D.C., was diagnosed with anthrax contracted by inhalation.Additionally, two other postal workers in Washington have died and their deaths are being investigated to determine if they died of that same ailment.But stocks took the anthrax reports in stride, suggesting a new and surprising level of confidence among market participants, some analysts said Monday."The market is really shrugging off this news," said Mark Donahoe, a managing director at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.Upbeat earnings news from American Express, released Monday afternoon, seemed to give stocks an additional lift.Investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and U.S. military maneuvers in Afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results, said Steven Kroll Sr., managing director at Monness, Crepsi & Hardt.The uncertainty on the global front "looks like it is going to be a long, drawn-out affair," Mr. Kroll said."I think stocks will revert back to being earnings-driven."  Although dismal by ordinary standards, last week's flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors, who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations."The markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings," said Mr. Donahoe of U.S. Bancorp.That resilience might be giving hope to investors this week, he added.Still, investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up, Mr. Kroll argued.Third-quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on Monday, with big companies such as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing and U.S. Steel posting results that met or topped analysts' estimates.The Dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p.m.EDT when index component American Express reported earnings that, excluding certain items, beat Wall Street previously lowered estimates.The financial-services concern posted net income of $298 million, or 22 cents a share, down 60% from $737 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier.Excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the September 11 attacks, American Express said it would have earned $595 million, or 45 cents a share, for the latest quarter.Analysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.Shares of American Express surged after the quarterly earnings release, closing up 3.4% at $30.32.Chip stocks helped lead the Nasdaq composite higher, with the Philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5.4%.The rally seemed to be a continuation of Friday's gains in the sector, sparked by positive earnings news from KLA-Tencor.U.S. Steel, the nation's No. 1 steelmaker, said it swung to a third-quarter loss from a profit a year earlier, hurt by oversupply and a weak economy.But excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another, U.S. Steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.Shares of U.S. Steel rose 9.7% to $14.74.Investors also sent 3M shares nearly 5% higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by Wall Street estimates, despite a 21% decline in net income.And oil producers Conoco and USX-Marathon Group handily beat analysts' forecasts.But not all the earnings news was cheery.Local phone company SBC Communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates.Shares of SBC, a component of the Dow industrials, fell 5.1% to $41.40.Meanwhile, the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging, some analysts noted.On Monday, 3M guided Wall Stret's earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter, and a top executive at U.S. Steel told analysts that the company's fourth quarter would be "difficult."  Companies "are meeting third quarter expectations, but they are talking down the fourth quarter," said Mr. Kroll of Monness Crespi & Hardt.He said that some of the rise in Monday's markets might be a carryover from Friday's buying activity related to the expiration of U.S. stock option and index option contracts, an event known as "double witching."  One of the hardest-hit stocks on Monday was Enron, an energy concern that said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was seeking information about certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer.Shares of Enron plunged 21% to $20.65.Overseas, stocks closed higher.London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index gained 1.1%, while Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index rose 2%.Earlier in the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.3%, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended 0.3% lower.In economic news, the Conference Board reported that its index of leading indicators for the month fell 0.5% in September, matching the estimates of economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets.The index -- a composite of measurements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy -- included some data gathered after the Sept. 11 attacks.The decline, which was the index's largest one-month drop since January 1996, confirmed that the widespread weakness in the U.S. economy is deepening, the Conference Board said.Falling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the September reading.In August, the leading-indicators index slipped 0.1%, less than the previous estimate of a 0.3% decline.Even so, the back-to-back declines paint a bleak economic picture, said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein.The two-month decline in the index suggests that the already-weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year, Mr. Goldstein said.The overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown.In major U.S. market action:  Stocks rose.On the Big Board, where 1.09 billion shares were traded, 1,813 stocks rose and 1,291 fell.On the Nasdaq, 1.49 billion shares changed hands.Bonds were mixed.The 10-year Treasury note rose less than 1/16 point Monday, or 62.5 cents for each $1,000 invested.The yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 4.618%.The 30-year bond fell 1/16 point to yield 5.364%.The dollar rose.The dollar bought 122.56 yen, compared with 121.20 yen late Friday.The euro traded at 89.18 U.S. cents, down from 89.84 cents late Friday.Copyright(c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Copyright ?2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Enron Faces Holder Suit From Fincl Chief Pacts  10/22/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright(c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

(ENE) filed a derivative suit in Texas court alleging that Enron's board breached their fiduciary duties to the company by allowing Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships.In a press release Monday, a law firm representing the unnamed shareholder said that Enron's board lost over $35 million by allowing Fastow to run these partnerships, which engaged in transactions with Enron and presented a conflict of interest.The suit alleges that the limited partnerships bought Enron assets, permitting Fastow to use his inside knowledge of the company's financial condition to earn millions of dollars.On Oct. 16, Enron announced that it will take a $35 million charge relating to the limited partnerships and revealed that the company had to repurchase 55 million of its shares in order to unwind its involvement in the partnerships, thereby reducing the company's shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.On Monday, Enron said the Securities and Exchange Commission recently requested additional information regarding the limited partnerships.On Oct. 19, The Wall Street Journal reported that Fastow, and possibly a handful of partnership associates, realized more than $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital increases on an investment of nearly $3 million in the partnership, which was set up in Dec. 1999 principally to do business with Enron.Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been with the firm 11 years, which included extensive work setting up and managing company investments.Enron's New York Stock Exchange listed shares fell to a 52-week low on Monday following news that the SEC requested additional information.A spokeswoman from Enron said the company has not seen the lawsuit and it does not comment on pending litigation.-Thomas Gryta; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5400    Copyright ?2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Shapiro Haber & Urmy Files Class Action on Behalf of Purchasers of Enron Corporation Stock (NYSE: ENE) in The Period From July 13, 2001 Through October 16, 2001  10/22/2001 PR Newswire (Copyright(c) 2001, PR Newswire) BOSTON, Oct. 22 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Shapiro Haber & Urmy LLP has filed a class action suit alleging securities fraud in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division), 515 Rusk Ave., Houston, Texas 77002, against Enron Corporation ("Enron") (NYSE: ENE) and certain of its officers and directors.The case was filed on behalf of all purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period from July 13, 2001 through October 16, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period").The complaint alleges that the defendants violated section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("the Exchange Act"), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and that defendants' wrongful conduct artificially inflated the price of Enron common stock during the Class Period.The complaint charges that the defendants misrepresented and concealed material facts concerning the Company's financial transactions with two partnerships established by Enron's Chief Financial Officer, which resulted in substantial losses to Enron and a reduction in shareholders' equity of over $1 billion.The price of Enron's common stock plummeted over 20% in just three trading days following disclosure of the financial losses resulting from Enron's dealings with these partnerships.Plaintiff seeks to recover damages suffered by class members and is represented by the law firm of Shapiro Haber & Urmy LLP, which has successfully prosecuted numerous securities class actions on behalf of defrauded investors.More information about the firm and its qualifications is available on the firm's website at www.shulaw.com.If you are a member of the class described above, you may wish to join the action.You may move the court to serve as a lead plaintiff no later than December 21, 2001.If you would like a copy of the complaint, would like to discuss joining this action as a lead plaintiff, or would like to inform us that you are a member of the proposed class, please contact Thomas G.

Shares of Enron Corp. slumped more than 20 percent on Monday after it said U.S. regulators are looking into company transactions, another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in August.A spokesman for North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, but said it was cooperating.The SEC also declined to outline details of its inquiry.Investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from The Wall Street Journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow.The company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years, and took $1.01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments.Problems at Enron surfaced two months ago when CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after only six months at the helm.Enron shares declined $5.49, or 21 percent, to $20.56 in Monday afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange, shaving off almost $4.2 billion of its market capitalization.The stock, the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the NYSE, fell as much as 22.8 percent on Monday, when it opened at its lowest level since September 1998.Shares declined 23 percent last week after the Journal ran its first story about the limited partnerships on Wednesday.Enron declined to comment on whether the SEC's inquiry into "certain related party transactions" involved the partnerships."Related party transactions" is the heading used by Enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and the larger LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars.Fastow severed his ties to the partnerships in June.LJM was set up in June 1999 for energy-related investments, and LJM2 in December 1999 for energy-and communication-related investments.The Journal reported $35 million of its third-quarter loss of $638 million were connected with the limited partnerships  Curt Launer, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said investors should question Enron's use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets, "most notably in telecommunications," have declined precipitously."Investors have had several opportunities to question Enron's credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined," Launer said.Some analysts, though, cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke."This is an inquiry, not an investigation, and I cannot imagine Enron's attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal," said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey."It's easy for the market to kick a company when its down, but these challenges do not last for a solid company, and we think Enron is one."

Lay said in a statement Monday."We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest."  Investors were upset by the news, however, sending shares of Enron down dlrs 5.30 to dlrs 20.75 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.The transactions took place in 1999 and 2000, according to Houston-based Enron's 2000 annual report.They resulted in a dlrs 16 million pre-tax gain to Enron in 1999 and a dlrs 36 million loss in 2000.Enron officials declined to provide details about the transactions or name the limited partnerships, instead referring questions to a section of the annual report on related party transactions."Enron entered into transactions with (limited partnerships) to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets," according to the section in the annual report.Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the SEC first contacted Enron last week and described the request is an "informal inquiry."  "This is not an investigation," he said."We see the request as an opportunity to put this issue behind us."  SEC spokesman John Heine said he could not comment on the filings."We can't confirm or deny that type of activity," Heine said.The electricity marketer and natural gas provider says both internal and external auditors and attorneys reviewed the related party arrangements, the company's board was fully informed of and approved the arrangements, and they were disclosed in the company's SEC filings.Copyright ?2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.STOCKWATCH Enron lower after SEC questions transactions; AG Edwards downgrades  10/22/2001 AFX News(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were down sharply in late morning trade, after the Securities and Exchange Commission requested the company to provide information on certain related-party transactions, prompting AG Edwards to downgrade the stock to 'hold' from 'buy', dealers said.At 11.10 am, Enron was down 4.29 usd, or 16.47 pct, at 21.76.The DJIA was up 57.57 points at 9,261.68, and the S&P 500 composite index was up 5.57 points at 1,079.05.In a statement this morning, Enron confirmed that the SEC had requested documents, and said it would "cooperate fully" with the commission.However, the company did not give any details of the transactions concerned or of the reasons behind the SEC's request.According to AG Edwards analyst Mike Heim, Enron "significantly reduced" its equity to unroll a partnership arrangement with a partially-owned subsidiary formerly run by Enron's chief financial officer."This arrangement, which was not discussed in past SEC filings, has led to a growing distrust of the company by the financial community.  "In our opinion, the market is most likely overreacting to the news being disseminated over the last few days."However, we can give no assurances that all the problems at Enron have been fully disclosed," Heim said.In its statement this morning, Enron said although its internal and external auditors and attorneys have reviewed the related-party arrangements, adding that the Board was "fully informed of and approved these arrangements", which were disclosed in the company's SEC filings."We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done," said chief executive Kenneth Lay.ng/gc For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com    Copyright ?2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Enron Corp.Information requested by SEC.10/22/2001 Regulatory News Service (C) 2001 INTNTH 22 October 2001  ENRON ANNOUNCES SEC REQUEST, PLEDGES COOPERATION HOUSTON - Enron Corp.

Enron Shares Slide as SEC Seeks Information on Deals With CFO's Partnership  10/22/2001 Dow Jones Business News (Copyright(c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) HOUSTON -- Shares of Enron Corp. slumped Monday after the energy-trading concern said the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for information about "certain related party transactions," including those between Enron and a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer.Enron promised to cooperate fully with the SEC request and said in a prepared statement that it "welcomes" the request and looks forward to put "any concern about these transactions to rest."In 4 p.m.EDT trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron (ENE) shares fell $5.40, or 21%, to $20.65.Last week The Wall Street Journal reported that a limited partnership organized by Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, made millions in profits in transactions with the firm.The story cited information reported in an internal partnership document.Enron also said last week it will repurchase up to 55 million shares that it had issued as part of transactions with LJM2 CO-Investment LP, the limited partnership created by Mr. Fastow.In addition, Enron took a $1.01 billion charge in the third quarter, mostly connected with write-downs of bad investments, producing a loss of $618 million, or 84 cents a share.Excluding charges, income was $393 million, or 43 cents a share, in the quarter.The charge covers a wide range of items including costs related to the limited partnerships that were, until recently, by Mr. Fastow.The company said the costs connected with the partnerships total $35 million and involve the early termination of "certain structured finance arrangements."  The partnerships were set up two years ago, and while the company maintains that they are perfectly proper, some have suggested that it is a conflict of interest for Enron's chief financial officer to be involved in a partnership that was looking to purchase Enron assets, the Journal reported.The energy company said its auditors reviewed the arrangements and its board was fully informed and approved the deals, which were disclosed in SEC filings."We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done," Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said on Monday.Separately, an Enron shareholder filed a derivative lawsuit in Texas court alleging Enron's board breached its fiduciary duties to the company by allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships.A law firm representing the unnamed shareholder said in a prepared statement that Enron's board lost over $35 million by allowing Mr. Fastow to run these partnerships, which engaged in transactions with Enron and presented a conflict of interest.The suit alleges that the limited partnerships bought Enron assets, permitting Mr. Fastow to use his inside knowledge of the company's financial condition to earn millions of dollars.-- Bill Platt of Dow Jones Newswires contributed to this report.Copyright(c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Copyright ?2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update8) 2001-10-22 17:10 (New York)  Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update8)       (Adds in sixth paragraph that analyst estimates dissolving affiliated companies would cost $3 billion.)       Houston, Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares fell 21 percent after the Houston-based company said the Securities and Exchange Commission requested information on partnerships run by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives.Enron, the largest energy trader, created partnerships and other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets such as power plants to lower the debt on its books.An investor sued Enron's board Wednesday, saying two partnerships cost the company $35 million and Fastow's leadership of them was a conflict of interest.Investors today said they were concerned that Enron may be forced to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the owners in cash or stock.Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he may be have to "unravel" agreements that created the companies if Enron's debt ratings fall too far."We need confidence their long-term credit rating won't go below investment grade," said Roger Hamilton, an analyst at John Hancock's value funds, which own 600,000 Enron shares.Enron reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion when it repurchased 55 million shares of two such partnerships controlled by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LMJ2 Co-Investment, the Wall Journal reported last week.Dismantling more of the affiliated companies and partnerships would cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, Ray Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to investors today.Enron shares fell $5.40 to $20.65.They touched $19.67 during the day's trading, the lowest level since Jan. 15, 1998.Shares Plunge       The stock has fallen 75 percent this year amid concerns about failed investments in trading of space on fiber-optic communications networks and a water company, and the resignation of Jeff Skilling as CEO in August after seven months on the job.While Skilling said he resigned for personal reasons, investors say his departure led them to question whether the company was concealing problems, including possible liabilities from affiliated companies.On Tuesday, Enron surprised many investors when it reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, the result of writing off $1.01 billion in failed investments.Moody's Investors Service placed the company's debt on watch for possible downgrade.The company's debt is rated at investment grade by Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's.The company received a faxed request for information from the SEC on Wednesday asking for information, spokesman Mark Palmer said, and will respond "as soon as possible."       "We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest," Lay, who is also Enron's chairman, said in a statement.Dilution Fears       Enron has formed at least 18 companies to serve as financing vehicles for its projects, based on filings with the Texas secretary of state.Fastow and other Enron executives are named as the controlling partners or the board members in the companies.Some have bought Enron assets such as power plants, removing the debt for those projects from Enron's books.That allows Enron to keep cash earned from the main trading business from supporting what it views as secondary businesses, Standard & Poor's debt analyst Todd Shipman said.Enron brokers trades of electricity, natural gas and other commodities as well as owns power plants and natural-gas pipelines.Dismantling the affiliates would be costly.Whitewing Management, an affiliated company that has bought 14 Enron power plants and lists Fastow as managing director, holds 250,000 preferred shares of Enron.Enron may have to convert the preferred shares to common stock if share prices fall below a certain level and the credit rating drops below investment grade, according to company filings.That would dilute the value of common shareholders' investment."The concern is how many of these dilutive structures are out there?"Shipman said."Investors are worried they might have to share their Enron earnings with a lot more people than they originally thought."                          Worrisome Financing       Enron's auditors and attorneys reviewed the company's "related party arrangements," the board approved them, and they were disclosed in SEC filings, Enron said in its statement.That hasn't eased concerns.The reduction of shareholder equity by $1.2 billion from the LJM partnerships is reason to worry about Enron's other financing vehicles, wrote Niles, the Salomon analyst.Enron also may take another $2.4 billion in losses from investments in the Dabhol power plant in India and projects in South America, he wrote.Enron's 8 percent coupon bonds due in 2005 fell $34 per $1,000 face value to be offered at $1,022 today from $1,056 on Friday, traders said.Yield on the debt rose to 7.33 percent from 6.33 percent.Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long- term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above investment grade.Fastow continues to work, and Enron hasn't punished him, Palmer said.Fastow declined to be interviewed, spokeswoman Karen Denne said.SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on the agency's request to Enron."We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done," Lay said in the statement.UniPrime Signs Letter of Intent for Wind Energy Park Project  10/22/2001 Business Wire (Copyright(c) 2001, Business Wire) APACHE JUNCTION, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct.22, 2001--UniPrime Capital Corporation Inc.

Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis lowered his rating to "hold" from "buy" on Friday.He said he has been looking for discussion of the partnerships in Enron's SEC filings and is only seeing "vague references" that don't leave him with a "good comfort level."       With Heim's rating change, Enron went from being the second most highly rated stock in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index to the 10th, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.Today, Zach Wagner at Edward Jones & Co. in St. Louis cut Enron to "reduce" from "accumulate."Ratings by Edward Jones, which caters to individual investors rather than institutions, aren't tracked by First Call.First Call translates analyst ratings into numbers, with "strong buy" a one, "buy" a two, and so on, then averages the ratings to rank a company's Wall Street popularity.The most highly rated stock is Tyco International Ltd., which has fallen 12 percent this year.Enron shares fell 86 cents to $19.79 today.Remaining Skeptical       However highly brokerage analysts rate the stock, "I have to remain skeptical," said Barry Borak, energy analyst at David L. Babson & Co., which manages $60 billion in Cambridge, Massachusetts."There's been a huge loss of management credibility at Enron," Borak said, because of the partnerships and the unexpected departure in August of Jeffrey Skilling, who had held the post of chief executive officer for six months and was heir apparent to Lay."Nobody I've talked to thinks (Skilling's departure) is for personal reasons," Borak said.Skilling helped transform Enron from a gas pipeline company into the biggest energy trading company.Enron also owns power plants in deregulated markets.Borak said Babson doesn't own Enron shares and won't be a buyer "until I can get better, more thorough information about what else might pop up in the future."       Borak and other investors said Enron has a reputation for not providing enough information about its businesses, and they said this makes the positive view of the company on Wall Street more difficult to understand.After Skilling resigned, Lay said the company would be more open about its businesses.A bullet point in his talk in Boston was "increased transparency of financial and operating results," according to a handout provided at the Boston meeting.Amazed, Dismayed       Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale wrote in a note to clients last week that she was "amazed at the willingness of Enron's management to break out earnings and expenses to the degree that it disclosed in the third quarter."       Coale also wrote that she was "dismayed by the apparent 'disguise' of the additional $1.2 billion equity hit that was not disclosed in (Enron's) press release and was briefly mentioned in the earnings conference call."Coale kept her rating on Enron at "buy."       Phelps at John Hancock said that his "cynical side" believes that investment banking business has helped keep Wall Street recommending Enron stock."They provide some good underwriting business," he said.Credit Suisse First Boston managed a secondary sale of 12 million Enron shares in 1999, with Lehman Brothers acting as co-manager.Credit Suisse has also managed bond sales for Enron this year.Enron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1) 2001-10-23 16:38 (New York)  Enron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)       (Updates with closing share price in sixth paragraph.)       New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the biggest energy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750 million loan, ensuring access to credit if the company is cut off from money markets, say people familiar with the matter.Enron's shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating its finances.The company depends on a $3 billion commercial paper, or short-term debt, program to finance day-to-day operations.Moody's Investors Service last week placed all $13 billion of the company's long-term debt securities on watch for possible downgrade.Any drop in the rating may cut off Enron from the commercial paper market, raising the costs of short-term debt."We understand that our credit rating is critical to both the capital markets and our counterparties," Enron's Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow said on a conference call today.He said Enron has $3.5 billion available on bank credit lines, giving it enough cash to operate normally.Dan Noonan, a spokesman for Citigroup's Citibank NA unit, declined to comment.Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, also wouldn't comment.Shares of Enron, based in Houston, fell 86 cents to $19.79.They have fallen 76 percent this year.Complex Financing       An investor sued Enron last week, saying dealings with two partnerships run by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, cost the company $35 million.The suit also calls Fastow's leadership of the partnerships, set up to remove debt from Enron's books, a conflict of interest.Enron bought back 62 million shares to unwind positions in some partnerships run by Fastow, said Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay on the conference call with investors today.The number of shares differs from a Wall Street Journal report on Thursday that said Enron had bought back 55 million shares.The buyback reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion, the Journal said.The company set up the partnerships and other affiliated companies to buy Enron assets such as power plants.The partnerships allow Enron to take debt off its books, letting it borrow to invest in its main business of commodities trading, Enron said.Enron trades electricity, natural gas, oil, coal and other commodities."'They have complex off-balance sheet financing," said Commerzbank analyst Andre Mead."It's difficult to ascertain the full impact on shareholders."       The SEC has asked Enron about partnerships and affiliated companies headed by Fastow.The company has at least $3 billion in such "off-the-books" financing in affiliated companies, Ray Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to investors.Depends on Asset Sales       One partnership, Whitewing Management, owns 250,000 preferred shares that Enron may have to convert to common stock.Whitewing partners can demand their preferred shares be converted if Enron common stock falls below a certain price or if Enron's credit rating drops under investment grade.Whitewing and other Enron partnerships and trusts include company executives as officers and directors, according to records from the Texas secretary of state."Over the life of these trust structures, Enron has in fact issued a sizable amount of equity," Enron Treasurer Ben Gilsan said.Most of that was shares issued to Enron executives as part of a deferred compensation plan, Gilsan said.The Whitewing partnership was financed with $1.4 billion in bonds sold last year.The partnership used some of the proceeds to buy Enron power plants and plans to retire the debt by selling them, officials said on the conference call.Other company partnerships operate with the same strategy."Some investors are worried the asset sales won't cover the full amount (borrowed), and Enron will have to furnish support to the detriment of shareholders," said Commerzbank analyst Meade.Commercial Paper Rates       Enron was paying 3.15 percent to issue commercial paper until Oct. 31, which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies with the same "A2/P2" short-term credit ratings that are not on credit watch.Enron's short-term debt is not on review for a possible downgrade.Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long- term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above investment grade.Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's rate the company's debt at investment grade.Enron has previously turned to Citigroup for finance and advice.In 1999, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit advised the company on its $1.45 billion acquisition of three natural gas- fired power plants from Cogen Technologies Inc.Citibank, along with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., this year arranged a $1.75 billion loan.How Enron Blew It Texas Monthly November 2001  Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon= ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo= st important company in the world.Now its stock is down, wall street is be= arish, and the CEO is gone.What went wrong?by Mimi Swartz <http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.p= hp> =20 THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th= e international headquarters of the best and the brightest.The lobby in no=  way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c= ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby.Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod= ernity.The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b= rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born.T= hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif= orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu= blic button-downs.Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin= g intently, like winners.Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-= size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva= tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe= ople entering from the garage.A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti= pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi= s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe= inated.Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula= ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e= levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: "From the World's = Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"  For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro= m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000= .It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per= cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil= lion to $100 billion."The very mention of the company in energy circles th= roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"=  notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma= rket intelligence to the energy business.This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine= d to transform American business.Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b= y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old = formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then = selling it to refineries and other customers.Instead, it evolved into a co= mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=  to electricity, from wind to water.If you had a risky drilling venture, E= nron would fund it for a piece of the action.If you wanted your megacorpor= ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job.If y= ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning = power needs, Enron was there to build and build.Basically, if an idea was = new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra= ck.And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny.T= he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo= rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe= eded Lay as chief executive officer.Enron, says Skilling, "was a great mar= riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me= ntality of the financial markets."  The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en= d of the twentieth century.Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=  was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ= an economy.Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a = culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t= he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh= o could see the future versus those who could not.The key was investing in=  the right kind of intellectual capital.With the best and the brightest, a=  company couldn't possibly go wrong.Or could it?Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of = $80 in January.The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene= rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=  his relentless defense of the free market.A long-troubled power plant pro= ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions.Telecommunications= , in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded.Wall Street analysts who o= nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices.Some of the cha= nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer= tain times that has afflicted all of American business.But the culture tha= t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD "a totally different way of thinking about b= usiness-we got it."At Enron, in fact, you either "got it" or you were gone= -it was as simple as black and white.It is not coincidental, then, that th= e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he = once headed.Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga= ny floors.Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets.Billowy sofas set=  off the jet-black baby grand.In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b= lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar= ble.There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil= ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus= t six months as CEO.Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene= ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame= rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc= hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, "someone cou= ld actually get killed."Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr= istmas morning."I had no idea what I'd let go of," Skilling says of all th= e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20  From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=  photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies.The demands o= f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances.Divorc= ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash= er.He almost missed his brother's wedding."Learning a foreign language-I = never learned a foreign language!" he exclaims.He never once took his youn= gest son to school."I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte= en-minute scheduling."Travel: "You can't go to Africa for a week and get a= nything out of it!"Skilling includes the study of architecture and design = on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs."I'm not sure=  that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job," he says, finally= .Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it= s pragmatic edge."It would have been easy to stay," he says."But that wou= ld not have been good for me."=20  He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand= some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi= duously stolid gaze.But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=  underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r= eporters who have labeled his resignation "bizarre" and associates who are = bitterly skeptical of his need for family time.His shrug stretches the lim= its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=  upon."I'm surprised," he says, "that people have so much trouble understa= nding this."  PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni= neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo= lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building.From nine t= o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist= ine silver skyscraper to smoke.They perched on the chrome banisters or lur= ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad.They always looked=  hurried and furtive, even ashamed.Whatever people knew about Enron in tho= se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th= at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters = in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=  the energy world of the past.What macho engineer would have put up with s= uch humiliation?But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti= es when chaos enveloped the gas business.Federal deregulation of natural g= as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque= ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v= olatile free-for-all.The situation was compounded five years later by fede= ral deregulation of the pipeline business.So it happened that a gentlemanl= y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=  from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm.HNG wa= s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc= o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy.(His doc= toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V= ietnam War.)Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar= dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H= NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat= e of Texas.HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte= mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska = pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i= n the country at the time.Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=  in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like = Coastal.What the Nebraskans blithely labeled "the purchase" was being call= ed "the merger" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular= ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr= avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru= nning a new company called Enron."Over time it became clear that Lay had a=  better vision of the future," says one person associated with Enron at tha= t time."He never fought change. He embraced change."  Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean?Enron was saddled with massive=  debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had = exclusive use of its pipelines.Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole = new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s= tarted.=20  LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha= d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h= ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I= llinois.(His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) "I l= iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart," he told Busines= sWeek earlier this year.But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling = wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he = was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w= hat he would come to call "intellectual capital."He loved being smart, and=  he loved being surrounded by smart people.He graduated from Southern Meth= odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too= k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi= s class.Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-= up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as = a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20  It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless= , and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company.Skilling was above=  all an expert at markets and how they worked.While everyone else was worr= ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al= one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses.And so in a world w= here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=  called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th= e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers.Enron would not be = a broker but a banker.It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the = risk involved.And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv= estment bank would.Skilling worked up some numbers and found them "absolutely compelling."The= n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec= utives.He had a one-page presentation."Almost to a person," Skilling says= , "they thought it was stupid."Almost.After Skilling left the meeting dej= ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized.Lay listened and th= en said, "Let's go."  The Gas Bank was not an overnight success.For months Skilling woke up in a=  cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze= ns of colleagues who had assisted him.In fact, he had come upon one of tho= se divides that seem to define his life: "I believed this whole world would=  be different, a huge breakthrough" is the way Skilling puts it today, and = even if he is typically immodest, he was right.Fairly soon after launching= , the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week.True to Skilling's = character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=  joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, "We were in= ."And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr= on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo= r him.In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit= .After that, says Skilling, "we never looked back."  Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha= d a trading component.Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w= ould make the project go.But by buying and selling enormous quantities of = gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin= ate it.The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b= est access to supplies.That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted = to be part of the play.With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b= etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m= ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p= rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi= th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could = have ever imagined.THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m= ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin= ess.The idea was to build a "knowledge-based business," which demanded a s= kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days.Mos= t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o= f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=  industry regulated by the federal government.But now the company needed b= older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make = money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company."Enron was going to=  create a niche for itself or die," one former executive explains."The peo= ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na= rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market."Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people.He wanted the s= martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice.And be= cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he = wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big= gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B= oston.In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be "a= ggressive."You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w= ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20 You could see what he was looking for on "Super Saturdays" at the Houston h= eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee= n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=  day.They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a= bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called "a sense = of urgency."People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched.The shrewdest = candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t= he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing = Enron would come back with more.The starting salary was around $80,000.Ma= ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more = than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof= ts being renovated close to downtown.(Enron people didn't live in far-flun= g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a= nd-talented program.New associates learned the latest techniques for struc= turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g= lobe.The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of.A com= pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=  with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th= e house, planning a vacation.Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr= on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou= ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers.If they were ov= erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra= m.Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t= en at night."They were so cutting edge," rhapsodizes someone involved with=  the company health care program at the time."They really thought about th= e psychology and what it took to keep these people going."Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts= , associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos= e titles didn't really matter.Money did.Instead of competitive salaries a= nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus= es-with no cap."If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=  make a lot of money," says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un= til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div= ision.Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed.Gas traders = with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus= .And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join= ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of= f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp= ectacular Mexican villa."Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'= d say," one loyalist says.=20 And why not?By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m= erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market.But at a company where the b= uzzword was "aggressive," that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie= ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=  Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv= ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega= n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa= ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se= rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer= e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo= rts).But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling.In 1997 Ken Lay m= ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company.By then, = the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar= gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity.The divisio= n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $= 2 billion to $7 billion."Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil=  in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track," the New = York Times noted.Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill= ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran= sforming another."FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"=  sang the New York Times in 1999."In the staid world of regulated utilitie= s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis," crowed For= tune in 2000.Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl= e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million= , up 30 percent from the previous year.That year the company seemed to dis= cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste= el, and even weather.No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=  client.People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg= e against the usual winter downturn?But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c= ommunications.Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be= came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o= nline in 2000.Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi= d price and the asking price.Then there was the broadband business: To Enr= on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt= y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi= ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines.So Enron created a market for wha= t the industry calls bandwidth.Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=  deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=  in their homes.Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose."Its strat= egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo= dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market," BusinessWeek insis= ted.There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: = the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers.The old notion of c= ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust= omers to keep them.But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t= o come to it.Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli= ents as customers and began calling them "counterparties."Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m= aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=  overtaxed and overregulated.So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur= e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi= l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un= derwrite the project, if it ever would.But because Enron invented its mark= ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals= , from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene= d at all.=20 While many businesses used what was known in the industry as "mark-to-marke= t accounting," for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale.The c= ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=  idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge= t deals.And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an= nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front.How= ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=  went on the books in the current year.If a few analysts thought there mig= ht be something fishy about what they called "subjective accounting," inves= tors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in.As the mark= et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec= t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't = going to be high enough."Enron is known for leaving people at the altar," = says one former employee.Winning the highest possible profits for the comp= any could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity.When a fundraiser=  for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c= ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe= ting literacy charity: "Even the person who was supposed to give money away=  for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron," he says.As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created = took on a dark side: The competition turned inward.As one member of the En= ron family put it, "It became a company full of mercenaries."The change st= arted at the bottom.As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most = of the recruiting frills fell away.New associates were treated much like t= he commodities the company traded.Global Change's Enron spies reported ove= rhearing orders like "I need a smart person-go buy me one" or "Buy me an in= telligent slave, quick."Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl= e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa= rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months.It was to= o disruptive.People couldn't get their work done.And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension= .The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S= killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s= ystem in the country.Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t= hose with fives were usually gone within six months.(The PRC's nickname qu= ickly became "rank and yank.")It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi= sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year.As one Skilling assoc= iate put it, "Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=  store."Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro= n's attitude toward its workers.In time, it would become many workers' att= itude toward the company.Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur= e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus.If protocol required an Enr= on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=  he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m= ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: = "They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s= ight of the future," says one former employee.Anyone who couldn't close de= als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u= ps who had backed them.Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte= n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase "No old tapes" became a= n Enron clich?."People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight," says=  one former Enron executive.In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered.New contracts contained highly restr= ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=  E-mail was monitored.A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on= e for the company and one for himself.People may have been rich at Enron, = but they weren't necessarily happy.One recruiter described the culture thi= s way: "They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y= ou bleed to death."BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy = company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J= ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i= ts remaining old order.Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea= lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d= ealt with intangible assets.Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr= on's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone.Expensive, long-term building pr= ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm= ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it."It wasn't the tim= e for long-term approaches," an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=  "It was the technology era."To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe= cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job.Mark was for many ye= ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n= ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th= e requisite Harvard MBA.Mark was largely responsible for the success of En= ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed = $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o= f Enron's profits in 1998.For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on= e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including = two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo= rate America.But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi= a, one of the largest ever constructed.She had played the game the Enron w= ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p= ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c= hanges in government.But the time and expense needed to make India and oth= er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals= , and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter.Key executives left, divisio= ns were dismantled, but she remained.The truth was Enron didn't mind firin= g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen= tless people it tended to promote.The company preferred humiliation-keepin= g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=  deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title.(One particularly d= ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.)A company a= s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=  visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa= ster.So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar= k her own company.Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, = Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti= lity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri= vatization.Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate= st water company.Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth= er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20 But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a = business fraught with political and emotional complexities.Water is not li= ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=  it up, even for lots of money.The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an= d confidence evaporated.By August 2000 the stock price, which had started = out at $19, had fallen to $5.Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=  diminished, was folded into Enron."I think it's best for Rebecca to start=  afresh," Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=  Or as one critic put it, "They were more interested in destroying the old = culture than running a business."=20 As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command.In December Ken Lay=  announced the inevitable: "The best time for the succession to occur is wh= en the company is doing well," he told the press."Enron is doing extremely=  well now."In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED.Enron's domination of the electric-= power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac= le.Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t= he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L= ay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg= e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo= od or electricity.Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent = anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=  the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif= ornia, as both tried to buy power online.The Times reported that Lay had t= ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d= eregulation.The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=  was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we= aknesses.By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=  January.Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline.(The = India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of = constant turnover within Enron's management team.)But the California situa= tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th= at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population = and never properly managed those it had."For three months Gray Davis did a=  very good job of blaming us," says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo= rate communications."We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi= te House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big= gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c= are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis." (Californi= a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=  be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al= l too apparent lack of contrition.Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo= ke comparing California with the Titanic.("At least the Titanic went down = with its lights on.")But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had = been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price.Investors=  believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=  it had revolutionized gas and power.Enron estimated the global market for=  buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi= on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst.So too d= id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster.For the first tim= e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma= rket.Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=  Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t= he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant.D= uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal= lenged Enron's financial reporting an "asshole."When the company reported = hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit= s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse= ts.Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr= omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner."Th= ere wasn't any positive news," Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n= ow."Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade."The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly.Fortune had aske= d in March whether Enron was overpriced.("Start with a pretty straightforw= ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?")The routine cashing = in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray= ed in the media as a fire sale.(Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L= ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.)Then the Wall Street Jour= nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with= in the company.(It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl= e failures.)Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th= e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40.Enron, so institutio= nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine."When Wall Stre= et is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,= " says Carol Coale."When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca= rry more weight."This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e= xperiencing an attack of conscience.Those who had looked the other way as = the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec= retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th= eir ways."It just created an attitude," one executive still at Enron says.=  "If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th= ere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"=20 Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=  now.An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi= p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road."But," as=  one Houston oilman explains, "if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit= h someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati= on that's better suited for good times than bad."As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too.As the sto= ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=  and frustration.Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe= es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi= m, Enron was over.Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named = a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors= , and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future.Trading anything and = everything was out.The company, Lay says, will still innovate but "innovat= e much closer to our core."As for the culture: "Things like the Performanc= e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate= gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo= rale problem."That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=  of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=  their lack of emotional intelligence.Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi= th Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie= ved in cutting losses and moving on.But now that he was abandoning them wh= en the company was in trouble, it was different."Even Jeff's biggest detra= ctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door," one loyalist admits.But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back."Look," he s= ays with finality, "ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron.

Enron Fails to Smooth Things Over By Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com> Senior Columnist TheStreet.com 10/23/2001 01:07 PM EDT URL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10002864.html>  Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) held a special conference call Tuesday=  to address investor concerns that have weighed heavily on its stock.=20 But worries may persist after the energy trader offered few new details and=  the CEO publicly sparred with a gadfly investor over a shadowy off-balance=  sheet transaction.=20 The transaction that has drawn most attention in the past week is a complex=  financing that Enron entered into with a partnership called LJM2, which wa= s led by Enron's finance chief Andrew Fastow.Terminating this arrangement = led to a $1.2 billion equity reduction in the third quarter.Monday, Enron = stock plunged 20% after the company said the Securities and Exchange Commis= sion is probing "related party transactions."Executives declined to respon= d to questions about Fastow's role in the LJM2 partnership on the Tuesday c= all.=20 Another key issue is the impact of the equity reduction.The company said o= n the call that its share count would decline by 60 million in the fourth q= uarter, due to the termination of the LJM2 financing.But CEO Ken Lay said = the company wouldn't be increasing its earnings guidance of $1.80 a share f= or 2001 and $2.15 for 2002.=20 When a share count drops, earnings per share should normally increase, assu= ming the earnings number stays constant.The 60 million shares are equivale= nt to about 6.5% of the company's diluted total in the third quarter.As a = result, Enron should have raised its per-share profits forecast by about th= at much, assuming constant earnings.=20 When asked on the call if earnings per share guidance would be increasing, = CEO Lay replied that the company had previously increased its guidance for = this year.He then affirmed the 2002 number.=20 Now, to be fair, Enron may not be forecasting lower earnings.The planned r= eduction in shares may simply bring the total share count back close to a l= evel in the fourth quarter and 2002 that analysts had originally expected.= Notably, the share count in the third quarter jumped by 20 million, meaning=  a fourth-quarter reduction might not change matters that much.Alternative= ly, Enron may beat fourth-quarter estimates by 6.5%; perhaps the company ha= s simply chosen not to increase guidance at this stage, given uncertainties=  in the economy.In any case, more clarity on this matter is clearly needed= .=20 Calls to Enron weren't immediately returned.The stock edged up 2% Tuesday = after falling nearly 40% since last week amid worries about complex off-bal= ance sheet deals.=20 The call, arranged after Enron's Monday plunge, contained a lot of queries = about two trusts, called Marlin II and Whitewing, against which Enron borro= wed some $3.4 billion.Lay became testy after questioning by Richard Grubma= n of Boston-based hedge fund Highfields Capital Management.Grubman, who wa= s called an "a--hole" by Enron's former CEO Jeff Skilling on an April confe= rence call, was trying to find out the value of water assets held by Marlin=  II.The optimal way of paying back money borrowed through the trust is to = sell the water assets.=20 Grubman's line of questioning implied that the Marlin assets were worth onl= y about $100 million, meaning Enron would have to find about $900 million t= o pay off the Marlin II-related debt.Grubman arrived at $100 million after=  factoring in what he saw as the effects of a third-quarter writedown to wa= ter assets, some of which are included in Marlin II.=20 Lay disputed the $100 million number.At one point, he accused Grubman of d= riving Enron's stock down and monopolizing the Tuesday conference call.In = the middle of Grubman's comments, Lay told the call operator to go to the n= ext caller.=20 Grubman didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.=20 If Enron has to find $900 million, this can be done by issuing stock or rai= sing cash on its balance sheet.If the latter route is taken, Enron says it= 's likely to use asset sales to generate the cash. Enron executives said li= quidity would be sufficient and detailed at least $3.35 billion in availabl= e credit lines.=20 But if Enron's debt-to-capital ratio exceeds 65%, the covenants on some of = those lines are broken. After the $1.2 billion equity writedown and other c= harges taken in the third quarter, that ratio is probably about 50%-55% (En= ron hasn't released a third-quarter balance sheet to arrive at an exact cal= culation). It would take $3 billion in further writedowns or charges to pus= h Enron's debt-to-capital ratio up to 65%.=20  Stocks=20 More Static For Enron=20 Forbes.com staff, Forbes.com 10.23.01, 11:15 AM ET=20  NEW YORK - Enron scrambled again to reassure investors this morning, after = it disclosed yesterday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had=  asked for information on partnerships run by Chief Financial Officer Andre= w Fastow and other executives.=20  Enron (nyse: ENE ) last week reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million = after taking $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments.

Enron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fasto= w, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock = price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major=  energy-trading companies.=20 Investors appeared worried that Enron's recent woes could have a destabiliz= ing effect on the energy-trading market.The Houston energy powerhouse, wit= h annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billi= on, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation's t= raded-electricity and natural-gas volumes.In less than two years of operat= ion, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for = the energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in trans= actions."Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that," said Merrill Lynch an= alyst Donato Eassey."There's not a trader out there that doesn't use Enron= Online."As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in = which the company's credit-worthiness is critical.Enron said its business = operations were functioning normally yesterday.The company also has consis= tently said it is financially strong and liquid.=20 Enron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-= old head of the company's industrial-markets division.His selection may be=  intended, in part, to raise the company's credibility.People familiar wit= h the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voic= ing concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow's role in running two limi= ted partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transac= tions with Enron.Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and po= ssibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnershi= ps.Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face=  of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street=  analysts and major Enron investors.On Monday, Enron announced that the Se= curities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transa= ctions.=20 While Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as=  the company's dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arran= gements clearly played a role in the executive's departure."In my continue= d discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that rest= oring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO," said Ch= airman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement.=20 Enron said Mr. Fastow "will be on a leave of absence from the company."He = couldn't be reached for comment.=20 It remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow's removal will assuage an increas= ingly restive investment community.The action came after the 4 p.m. market=  close and followed a day in which Enron's stock once again plunged.As of = 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $= 16.41, down $3.38, or 17%.It topped the Big Board's most active list at ne= arly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-activ= e stock.Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more= , possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron = stock.=20 Enron's shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week.Earlier = this year, the stock was above $80 a share.=20 In an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies,=  which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday.For instance, D= ynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26.A num= ber of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies muc= h different than Enron's, which rely heavily on complex and highly structur= ed investment vehicles.=20 Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow's departure could=  be seen as evidence that "management does care" about investor concerns.H= owever, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming a= s it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as "an admissi= on of guilt."Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron lar= gely because of uncertainties about the company's extremely complex financi= al structure.=20 Enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings= .=20 Worries and rumors about Enron's financial strength could be found in the s= tock market yesterday.Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard = people voice concerns about a possible "death spiral" in which increasing c= redit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to d= o business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and le= ad to further business reductions.Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still = has a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn't yet seen any eviden= ce of such a problem.=20 However, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about=  its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other e= ntities.Enron is facing a problem with "trust and credibility.

Fastow, who= se involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutin= y of the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20 "In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear=  to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy = as C.F.O.," Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in = a statement announcing the change.Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told in= vestors in a conference call that he and the Enron board "continue to have=  the highest faith and confidence in Andy."The company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also = named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial market= s group and a former corporate treasurer.=20 Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night.= =20 The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, wh= ere Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41.The price has been cut in half si= nce Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings.A $1.2 billion=  reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships wi= th partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earning= s news release.Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that fo= llowed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion=  write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered wh= en they later learned about it.=20 On Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with ana= lysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the=  transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr.=  Fastow.Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the detai= ls of the transactions.=20 The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's=  disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand= .=20 By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron = stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would n= ot lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity=  that had no effect on the income statement.That is one of the issues the = S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected t= o address.=20 Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from=  complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts of= f its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either i= n cash or with stock -- if things went wrong.On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assure= d investors that the company "expects to continue to have sufficient liqui= dity to meet normal obligations," and said it had bank credit lines that w= ere more than adequate.=20 Mr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, t= he former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in bu= siness strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an ene= rgy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following.Its st= ock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75.=20 According to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's=  successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time wa= s the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving M= r.Fastow presented a conflict of interest.After that discussion, Mr. McMa= hon moved to a different job at the company, this person said.=20 Shares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest pri= ce for the stock since early 1995, before recovering.In after-hours tradin= g, they fell to $16.14.=20 One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol=  Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to "sell"=  from "hold."She had lowered the rating to "hold" from "buy" on Mond= ay.=20 "After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced," she said in an interview yester= day evening, "Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as=  a gesture to the Street.

investors continued dumping shares.=20 Enron, which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons= , found itself high on Wall Street's hit list after it released third-quart= er earnings on Oct 16.=20 The earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analy= sts had already expressed displeasure at: Fastow, with the approval of Enro= n's board, had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman and=  LJM2 Co-Investment.=20 The partnerships, which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron,=  served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments.=20 But Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of = Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time.=20 So Fastow, in June, resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also e= nded its relationships with the LJM entities.During the third-quarter, Enr= on took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2=  billion reduction in shareholder equity.=20 Tuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously fo= llowed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected=  in dealings with the LJM partnerships.He said a "Chinese wall" existed be= tween Enron and LJM.=20 Fastow's replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron's treasurer befor= e moving last year to another job with Enron.Most recently, he headed up t= he company's industrial markets group.A source close to Enron said McMahon=  asked to be reassigned from the treasurer's job because he was uncomfortab= le with the Fastow-LJM setup.=20 Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available f= or comment Wednesday.He also didn't know whether Fastow is still

to rebuild investor = confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, wate= r and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skil= ling in August for personal reasons.=20 A continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followe= d the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry.=20 Wall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron's various fina= ncial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give=  analysts enough data to make proper evaluations.=20 Beyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partne= rships Enron set up.Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to = issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entiti= es.=20 Investors wouldn't like that because it would dilute the value of current o= utstanding shares.They are also afraid that Enron's debt credit rating may=  be downgraded, which could have

finance chief - Energy company = attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price.=20 Enron, the US energy group, yesterday replaced its embattled chief financia= l officer, Andrew Fastow, to try to halt a slide in its share price, which = has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week.Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive officer, said after the market closed = that Mr Fastow was taking a leave of absence.The move came a day after Mr = Lay defended Mr Fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partn= erships that had forced Enron to take a $1.2bn write-off.=20 That loss, revealed last week, sparked the share sell-off amid concerns the= re may be more bad news to come.Enron disclosed the loss during an October=  16 conference call with analysts on its third-quarter results, saying the = charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that Enron had set up in the=  partnerships established with Mr Fastow.=20 Analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained, leading to c= onfusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Ex= change Commission.=20 "In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear = to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a= s CFO," Mr Lay said.He said Jeff McMahon, chairman and chief executive of = Enron's industrial markets group, would replace Mr Fastow.Mr McMahon earli= er served as Enron's treasurer.=20 Analysts said it was unclear whether Mr Fastow's departure would be enough.=  Carol Coale, of Prudential Securities, said the move was positive in demon= strating that Enron was being sensitive to Wall Street, which had called fo= r Mr Fastow to be replaced.Yet, she added, it came three days after those = calls.=20 Ms Coale issued a

Perform' at Banc of America 2001-10-25 08:49 (New York)       Princeton, New Jersey, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg Data) -- Enron Corp. (ENE US= ) was downgraded to "market perform" from "strong buy" by analyst William=  J Maze at Banc of America.Baring Asset Management's McClen on Enron: Investor Comments 2001-10-25 08:09 (New York)       London, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments by Catherine McClen, who helps manage about $17 billion of bonds for Baring Asset Management, about Enron Corp.Yesterday, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into partnerships he ran that cost the largest energy trader $35 million.McClen said Baring bought credit-linked notes issued by Houston-based Enron during the summer."Given what has happened, with them basically firing Andy Fastow, the CFO, they've finally woken up to how concerned people are about the management-credibility issue."On a recent conference call "no one thought they did themselves any favor in terms of calming investors' concerns."       "They were slightly hiding behind the fact that the SEC has got this inquiry going. The fact that two days later Andy is gone, and he was in the center, is a good sign that the company is realizing just how concerned investors are."       "There's always that worry once the SEC gets involved that it could extend. You never know what could come of that."       "There is a bit of fear of the unknown about Enron now, with the SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset write-downs."       "Another thing they're criticized for is their lack of disclosure. We still haven't seen a balance sheet for the third quarter."       "People are saying, why don't you include a balance sheet with your results? They promised better disclosure in the past and that was meant to begin in the third quarter."       "You'd like to see just more information on asset write- downs and a discussion of their off-balance-sheet financing -- all these vehicles they have like Marlin and Osprey."       "We'd like to see some clarity, answering those sort of questions."       "It seems as though Enron at least are maybe at the start of a process where they're going to address and clean up their balance sheet and they've started to replace management."       "Investors have already had enough issues" in corporate bonds recently and "sometimes investors just think, 'Not another nasty in my portfolio,' and I'd rather exit."       "For certain investors maybe they just get scared. I wanted to know more about it. People had speculated if it could go to junk. I don't think they could because I don't think Enron could exist as a junk company."       "There's a certain reluctance" to sell the bonds. "You want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals."      "When the spreads have already moved out that wide you have to reassess and see whether you think it's a buying opportunity."  --Christine Harper in the London newsroom (44 20) 7330-7982 or charper@bloomberg.net /jom   Enron ousts CFO amid partnership questions By PAM EASTON Associated Press Writer  10/25/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001.The Associated Press.All Rights Reserved.HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. may have added another question to the list inve= stors already have by ousting its chief financial officer a day after the c= ompany stressed its confidence in Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Excha= nge Commission inquiry.=20 "It could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concer= n or it could be interpreted as if Enron removed the CFO at the request of = the SEC," Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale said Wednesday."W= ho knows?"Enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after = the energy trading giant's stocks have declined in value each day since Mon= day's announcement that the SEC had inquired about partnerships that did bu= siness with Enron while they were managed by Fastow.=20 "In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear = to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a= s CFO," Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay said after markets closed=  Wednesday.=20 Fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while Jeff McMahon, wh= o has served as chairman and chief executive of Enron's Industrial Markets = group, takes over his role.=20 "I think change is good at this particular point in time," said FAC Equitie= s analyst Robert Christensen said."I think Andy was somewhat beleaguered."= =20 A.G.

It took Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO.In oth= er words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers.How much fu= rther does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at t= he company?=20 The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and=  Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was nec= essary to rebuild investor confidence.=20 Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery.People got upset by one shad= owy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading bu= siness makes money.It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolat= ion and without the knowledge of the board.=20 In fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed t= he LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broad= band business.The board apparently feared the volatility that might come f= rom being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge=  that volatility away.This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it acce= ss to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from t= he downside.Should the whole board be on the hook, too?The spokeswoman re= sponds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had=  not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders.=20 Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views.= Arguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent=  on potentially skittish short-term financing.Letting things get this bad = has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers.It shows an u= nhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable.The = spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transp= arency.=20 Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonde= r people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management?=20   Phew!Enron Stinks By James J.

Thistime around they will not be able to block the move any more. The Indian  lenders alone cannot save the controversial $3 billion as some of the foreign  lenders are in favour of issuing the termination notice," said a source.The  Indian lenders are in favour of completing the project without any time and  cost over-run.They have disbursed about 80 per cent of their Rs 1,500 crore  worth of loan commitments to phase II of the project, 93 per cent of which is  complete.The trial run is expected to commence in June.The board of the  Dabhol Power Company has already authorised Enron India managing director, K  Wade Cline, to serve a termination notice as and when he deems fit.At a  meeting of the lenders last month in London, the foreign lenders were keen  that the termination notice be served in the face of defaults by the  Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Union government's refusal  to honour the counter-guarantee of Rs 102 crore for the December bill.The  domestic lenders are not covered by the counter-guarantee if the contract is  terminated.The foreign lenders are covered by the counter-guarantee.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Enron to suspend investments of 600 mln usd in Brazil energy sector  05/15/2001 AFX News (c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd  SAO PAULO (AFX) - Enron Corp will suspend investments of 600 mln usd in the  Brazilian energy sector, news agency JB Online quoted Enron vice-president  and Eletricidade e Servicos SA Elektro chairman Orlando Gonzales as saying.Of the total investment, 500 mln usd was to be assigned to the expansion of  the thermoelectric plant Cuiaba II in the state of Mato Grosso, and in the  construction of Rogen in the state of Rio de Janeiro, with the remainder to  be invested in unit Elektro, it said."There are no clear regulations for the sector.

(SCG) said in a  statement on Tuesday it will add around 200 million cubic feet a day, or  about six percent, to its pipeline system by the end of the year in order to  meet the surge in demand for gas-fired power generation.Today's announcement comes two months after SCG, a unit of Sempra Energy ,  proposed to increase capacity on its system by 175 mmcfd, or five percent.Both projects will add around 11 percent of new gas capacity to its  transmission system this year, the company said in a statement.In its latest proposal, called the Kramer Junction Interconnect, SCG said it  would build a 32-mile pipeline link to the Kern-Mojave pipeline system that  will allow it to deliver around 200 mmcfd into its system.The new capacity would be enough to drive three 500-megawatt power plants or  enough gas to serve 1.4 million residential customers a day, the statement  said.SCG, the nation's largest gas utility with more 18 million consumers in  central and Southern California, said utilization of its intrastate  transmission system in the past nine months had jumped from 75 percent to  over 95 percent, due largely to the rise in gas-fired power generation.The company's announcement is the latest in several proposals to expand gas  pipeline capacity to California, where demand for gas is expected to jump  because of the number of gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for  construction.Gas is already used to generate about a third of California's electricity.And since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant  projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts.Nine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than  6,000 megawatts, are under construction.Over the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving  California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos' Kern  River Transmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave  Pipeline Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group,  Questar Corp., Calpine Corp., and Kinder Morgan .Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity Market-Nikkei  05/15/2001 Dow Jones International News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  TOKYO (Nikkei)--Asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese  companies save as much as Y4 trillion, major U.S. energy firm Enron Corp.(ENE) on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market  by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and  distribution, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported.Enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power  plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to  households.If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to  match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector  could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said.At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company  asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity  auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant  benefits to end-users.New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the  entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant  facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies.Regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation  facilities asserted that "industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are  stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the  U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia."  In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which  last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity  supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a  company official.Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to  spin off different operations, analysts say.If the number of power  generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's  electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business  interest.Splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and  distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new  entrants.This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power  companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power  generation facilities, Enron says.Citing the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector  has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution  must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Enron Agrees to Provide Market Data to NGX  05/15/2001 PR Newswire (Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)  CALGARY, May 15 /PRNewswire/ - NGX Canada Inc. (NGX), a wholly owned  subsidiary of OM AB (OM), today announced that an arrangement has been made  with Enron Canada Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (Enron),  whereby trading data from certain contracts listed on Enron's online trading  system, EnronOnline will be included in the computation of three Alberta Gas  Price Indices.NGX acquired the AECO "C" & NIT Daily Spot, One-Month Spot, and Bid-Week Spot  gas price indices (Alberta Gas Price Indices) from Canadian Enerdata Ltd.last September.Subsequent to the acquisition of the Alberta Gas Price  Indices, NGX has provided real-time information to its customers on the  establishment of the weighted average price indices based on transactions  conducted through NGX's trading system.Canadian Enerdata Limited continues  to publish the Alberta Gas Price Indices in the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.Peter Krenkel, President of NGX, stated, "We believe that inclusion of data  from EnronOnline will serve to make our price indices among the best in North  America. The industry has been very supportive of the visibility and  integrity we are able to bring to the Alberta Gas Price Indices, which  removes the guesswork around gas price index methodology. However, after  reviewing the matter with Enron and other industry participants, we  recognized that Enron had legitimate concerns and the industry felt that  "more is better". The inclusion of data from the highly liquid EnronOnline  system should improve the quality of our price indices even further."  Rob Milnthorp, President and CEO of Enron Canada commented, "We are very  pleased to have EnronOnline transactions included in the Alberta Gas Price  Indices. This will provide industry participants with a more comprehensive  source of data and a better opportunity to manage risk around these price  indices as they are now assured that all their transactions on EnronOnline  will be included in the computation of the Alberta Price Indices."  The inclusion of EnronOnline data satisfies the principal claims made by  Enron in their legal action against NGX, Canadian Enerdata Ltd., OM and  Richard Zarzeczny and Enron has agreed to discontinue the legal action  against those parties with the conclusion of this arrangement.NGX and Enron are planning to implement the necessary system changes by  August 1, 2001 but in any event will provide at least thirty days notice to  the industry.Once in operation, data from transactions in the relevant  contracts listed on EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time.The  methodology for computing the Alberta Gas Price Indices will continue to be  on a weighted-average basis.NGX will engage independent auditors to insure full compliance with the Index  Methodology Guide.This guide is available on NGX's website at www.ngx.com.NGX located in Calgary, Canada provides electronic trading and clearing  services to natural gas buyers and sellers at seven markets in Canada.Over  the past six years, NGX has grown to serve over 120 customers with trading  activity averaging 225,000 TJ's per month.NGX is owned 100% by OM  (www.om.com).OM is a leader in providing products and services in the field of transaction  technology.The company, with assets exceeding CDN $700 million, operates  exchanges in Calgary, London and Stockholm and develops technology that  increases the efficiency of financial and energy markets throughout the  world.OM is listed on Stockholmsborsen (ticker symbol "OM").Enron Corp. is one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas and  communications companies.The company, with revenues of U.S. $101 billion in  2000, markets electricity and natural gas, delivers physical commodities and  financial risk management services to customers around the world, and has  developed an intelligent network platform to facilitate online business.Fortune magazine has named Enron "America's Most Innovative Company" for six  consecutive years.Enron's Internet address is www.enron.com.The stock is  traded under the ticker symbol "ENE".Canadian Enerdata Ltd.

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- If U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) pulls out of the $3.5  billion Dolphin gas project, in which the company holds a 24.5% stake, the  U.A.E. Offsets Group, or UOG, will consider other companies to replace it, a  United Arab Emirates industry source close to the project said Tuesday.Industry sources Monday said Enron is considering withdrawing from the  project because it doesn't believe it will be profitable.Dolphin, an agreement signed two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, plans  to bring 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore  North Field to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai.Enron and TotalFinaElf (TOT) each hold a 24.5% stake in the project, while  UOG owns the remaining 51%.Enron is set to focus on the midstream part of the project - gas  transportation - which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a  processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi  and the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai.The U.A.E. source said originally, it was thought that the U.A.E. government  would fund the pipeline, which is estimated to cost around $1 billion.However, more recently, the source said the U.A.E. suggested that Enron put  up the money itself.Other industry sources said Enron and TotalFinaElf also had to pay  significant fees to join the project.TotalFinaElf will operate the upstream part of the project, which includes developing natural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field.First wells are  scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in  2005.Last week, the Middle East Economic Survey reported that the foreign partners  haven't yet agreed on the precise details of their working relationship or on  the price of the pipeline.Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of UOG, signed an  initial agreement in March for the upstream section of the project.A full  agreement is expected to be concluded in September, the source said.-By Dyala Sabbagh, Dow Jones Newswires; 9714 331 4260;  dyala.sabbagh@dowjones.com  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2) 2001-05-15 16:35 (New York)  Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)       (Updates with closing share prices.)       Washington, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. should sell Portland General Electric Co. to Oregon so state consumers can be insulated from soaring electricity prices, a congressman said."Purchasing PGE would give Oregon ratepayers more control by keeping its assets in Oregon, accountable solely to Oregonians," U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Springfield, Oregon, said in a letter to Governor John Kitzhaber.The governor is considering DeFazio's proposal, said Kitzhaber spokesman Kevin Smith.Last month, Houston-based Enron, the biggest energy trader, agreed to cancel the $3.1 billion sale of Portland General, a utility with more than 700,000 Oregon customers, to Sierra Pacific Resources of Reno, Nevada.Enron and Sierra Pacific blamed laws spawned by high power prices and electricity shortages in the West for the sale's collapse."We are pleased to keep Portland General in our asset portfolio because it's a solid earnings performer," Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said."If approached by a buyer who recognizes its value, we'd consider selling it."She declined to comment on a potential bid by Oregon.The state should act swiftly, DeFazio said, citing press reports that the U.K.'s Scottish Power Plc, owner of PacifiCorp, the largest utility in the U.S Northwest, may bid for Portland General.Scottish Power, based in Glasgow, Scotland, would have more than 70 percent of Oregon electricity customers if it added Portland General, raising "serious regulatory concerns about market power," he said.Bond Issue       Oregon could issue bonds to purchase Portland General, using the utility's profits to pay the debt, DeFazio said.The state might run it as a public utility or a cooperative, he said.Enron and Sierra Pacific called off the Portland General sale because of laws passed by Nevada and California legislators that slow the deregulation of their wholesale power markets.California and Nevada have blocked sales of power plants by utilities.Sierra Pacific had to sell a stake in a Nevada power plant that sells power to California to win regulatory approval of the Portland General purchase.Average power prices on the California-Oregon border this year have soared ninefold to $296.34 a megawatt hour over the year- earlier period.A megawatt hour can light 750 average California homes for an hour.Shares of Enron fell $1.76 to $$56.99.They've fallen 31 percent this year.Sierra Pacific rose 9 cents to $16.09.Scottish Power rose 9 pence to 492 ($7) in London.Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1) 2001-05-15 16:26 (New York)  Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)       (Adds closing share price.)       Houston, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's biggest energy trader, agreed to provide natural-gas pricing information to NGX Canada Inc. and drop a C$100 million ($64.7 million) suit against the Canadian gas exchange.Enron sued NGX in November after the Internet exchange, a unit of the company that owns the Stockholm Stock Exchange, changed providers of its gas-pricing data and didn't include trades on EnronOnline, Enron's Internet exchange, when calculating gas-price indexes.Calgary-based NGX agreed to include EnronOnline trades in calculating its Alberta Gas Price Indices by August, Enron spokesman Eric Thode said.NGX, owned by Stockholm's OM Gruppen AB, is used by about 90 percent of Canadian gas traders, and many traders use EnronOnline to sell gas from western Canada, the biggest supplier of the cleaner-burning fuel to the U.S.      Houston-based Enron fell $1.76 to $56.99.",0,0,0

Caterpillar helped to lead a litany of earnings woes.The Peoria, Illinois-based company on Tuesday said its third-quarter earnings fell 5 percent because of higher expenses and less efficient manufacturing.The company also said it expects fourth-quarter revenues to be down slightly from the year-ago quarter, with full-year profit down 10 percent to 15 percent.It blamed economic uncertainty in the wake of last month's attacks for the expected shortfall, but added that 2002 sales will be at least flat to up slightly from 2001 levels.Unisys on Monday reported its third-quarter profits plunged by 50 percent due to weakening demand for high-end server computers and systems integration work.It said it would cut 3,000 jobs and slashed its fourth-quarter outlook.TAKING GRIM TIDINGS IN STRIDE  Other companies that have reported profit drops include Novellus Systems Inc., a maker of semiconductor production equipment, and Charles Schwab Corp., the top U.S. discount brokerage.Schwab said Tuesday that quarterly earnings fell 51 percent as customers avoided stocks all summer, although a surge in September trading pointed to better times ahead.Money managers are taking the grim profit tidings in stride."Most of these earnings situations are in these stocks," said Burnham."Barring unforeseens in the national and international situation, the market should work its way higher over the next 6 to 9 months."

Bryson Hull  10/16/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. on Tuesday reported its first loss in more than four years after taking $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments, including water and telecommunications services, which it said have clouded the strength of its core energy businesses.Enron, North America's biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power, said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company's stock lost two-thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company."What we've tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way," Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay said in a conference call.Lay reassumed the CEO mantle at Enron after his successor, Jeff Skilling, resigned in August after only six months at the helm.Houston-based Enron reported a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, or 84 cents a share, compared with net income of $271 million, or 34 cents a share, in the same period of 2000.It was Enron's first loss since the second quarter of 1997.The charges covered the company's loss-making broadband telecommunications business, its troubled water affiliate Azurix, and New Power Co., Enron's retail electricity joint-venture with AOL/Time Warner and IBM.Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade said it would probably take Enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a Wall Street favorite just 12 months ago."They do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting, they're a solid company, but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield," said Meade.Enron's stock closed 67 cents higher at $33.84 on Tuesday, but for the year it is down about 59 percent, underperforming the Standard & Poor's utilities index .SPU), which has fallen some 23 percent over the same period.ILL-FATED BUSINESSES  Originally a natural gas pipeline operator, Enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of U.S. energy markets to become the nation's dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity.The company moved into the water services business in 1998 by acquiring Britain's Wessex Water and forming Azurix, a unit which Enron took public in 1999 but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled.Enron helped set up New Power Co. and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about $28 per share to less than $2 as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated U.S. residential electricity markets.Enron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential.Enron's stock soared past sector peers last year when it posted a gain of 87 percent, driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform.But the stock has fallen sharply this year as broadband sentiment soured, Skilling resigned and wrangling continued over Enron's stalled Dabhol power plan project in India.Enron's third-quarter earnings before one-time charges rose to $393 million, or 43 cents a share, from $292 million, or 34 cents a share, meeting analysts' expectations of 42 to 45 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.The company reaffirmed its previously stated earnings targets of 45 cents a share for the fourth quarter, $1.80 for all of 2001 and $2.15 for all of 2002.DEBT ON CREDIT REVIEW  Rating agency Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday said it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade.The writedowns would reduce Enron's equity base, increase its nominal financial leverage and materially impact its earnings, Moody's said.Enron's third-quarter earnings report showed that income at its wholesale marketing and trading division, the company's backbone moneymaker, grew 28 percent.The division, which deals primarily in electricity and natural gas, saw pretax income rise to $754 million from $589 million in the third quarter of 2000.All of the income growth in the segment came from Enron's gas and power trading and marketing operations in the Americas, where income grew to $701 million from $536 million last year.The European segment, which includes gas and power operations there and other commodity sales like metals, coal and crude oil, remained flat at $53 million amid lower volatility.The latest earnings report marked the first time that Enron has provided a financial breakdown of the European and Americas wholesale operations.In doing so, Lay delivered on a promise he made after Skilling's departure: that he would make Enron's financial reporting more transparent.Many analysts and investors had grumbled about a lack of clarity from Enron.Copyright ?2000 Dow Jones &

sixth paragraph that losses are equal to 70 percent of Enron's profits over the last four quarters. Closes shares.)       Houston, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, had a $618 million loss in the third quarter after expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales cost the company $1.01 billion.The loss was 84 cents a share after payment of preferred dividends, Enron said.Net income a year earlier was $292 million, or 34 cents.Revenue rose 59 percent to $47.6 billion.Investors have sent Enron stock down 60 percent this year on concern about investments outside energy trading and natural-gas pipelines.Some investors praised Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive officer, for acknowledging the failure of the new businesses.Others said they're not confident all the bad news is out."What is disconcerting is that they didn't do this sooner," said Donald Coxe, manager of the $352 million Harris Insight Equity Fund."If you kill one cockroach in the kitchen, it doesn't mean there aren't more."       Investors have questioned Enron's financial reporting in the past year, especially after Jeffrey Skilling's resignation as CEO in August.Skilling, who helped Lay transform Enron from a gas- pipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading, said he left for personal reasons.Investors said they weren't confident Enron was detailing all its problems.Failed Businesses       The $1.01 billion in losses, which total $1.11 a share, are equal to 70 percent of Enron's $1.45 billion in profits over the past four quarters.Included were $544 million for losses on investments in New Power Co., a venture formed with AOL Time Warner Inc. and International Business Machines Corp.New Power competes for energy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power and gas suppliers as they do long-distance phone companies.The $544 million also includes losses from the Enron unit that trades space, known as bandwidth, on fiber-optic networks, as well as for the "early termination of certain structured finance arrangements" with an undisclosed "entity."Enron wouldn't be more specific.Enron said restructuring the fiber-optic unit would cost another $180 million, including severance pay to 500 fired workers.The business collapsed this year along with the fortunes of the dot-com companies that were expected to be some off its biggest customers.The declining value of assets owned by Azurix Corp., its water and sewage treatment business, will cost $287 million, Enron said.Enron might take a first-quarter "adjustment" of less than $200 million because of accounting changes related to goodwill, Lay said in an interview."If we thought there were any other significant concerns, we would have taken care of them today," Lay said.Excluding Losses       Minus the losses, Enron would have earned $393 million, or 43 cents a share, up 35 percent from the year-earlier period.That matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.Enron has averaged quarterly profit increases of 31 percent for the past year.Its wholesale services business, which includes energy trading, had income before interest, minority interests and taxes of $754 million, up 28 percent from a year earlier.Shares of Enron rose 67 cents to $33.84.Earlier, the stock had risen as much as 5.2 percent to $34.90."There's a sigh of relief that Enron's core businesses, its energy merchant businesses, are OK," said Roger Hamilton, who helps manage John Hancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares.Enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the fourth quarter, $1.80 for the full year and $2.15 in 2002.'Ridiculous Investments'       At one time, Enron pinned high hopes on the businesses that contributed to the $1.01 billion in losses.Enron spent $2.8 billion in 1998 for the U.K.'s Wessex Water, from which Azurix emerged.Enron sold shares to the public in 1999, and then bought back the company this year after Azurix failed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winning large projects.In August, Enron agreed to sell Azurix's North American business to American Water Works Inc. for $150 million.In February 2000, Lay said trading bandwidth could become the company's fastest-growing business.In the latest quarter, the bandwidth unit's loss before interest, minority interests and taxes widened to $80 million from $20 million a year earlier.Revenue plunged to $4 million from $162 million."You can make the case that Jeff Skilling leaving was for the best," John Hancock's Hamilton said."Under him, they built the best trading operation while also making all these ridiculous investments."       While admitting its poor choices, Enron also supplied more information this quarter about how it makes money.The company gave results of individual commodity-trading desks, including coal, forest products and steel."I liked that they broke out the different commodities," Hamilton said."I think Lay has gotten the message loud and clear, and that the effort is there."",0,0,0

Christina Cheddar  Dow Jones Newswires NEW YORK -- Although Enron Corp. plans to scale back its European operations, the Houston energy-trading company isn't looking to pare U.S. payrolls."There's nothing out of (the) ordinary planned for the rest of the business," said company spokeswoman Karen Denne."We are continuing to hire in the businesses most rapidly growing."  Those growing businesses include Enron Wholesale Services, she said.Earlier Thursday, Dow Jones Newswires reported the company would cut between 5% to 10% of its European staff, or as many as 500 workers.This past summer, the energy company announced staff reductions at its Enron Broadband Services division.The number of employees affected by this decision wasn't immediately available, Ms. Denne said.Before Thursday's announcement, the company's shares were trading lower on the New York Stock Exchange.But in afternoon trading today, shares of Enron (ENE) were up $1.11, or 3.3% to $34.60.With these latest gains, the stock is now up about 40% from the three-year low of $24.46 set a week ago.For several months, Enron shares have been under pressure as investors struggled to assess the impact of a number of negative developments, including declining energy prices, the recent and sudden departure of its chief executive, disappointing performance of its broadband unit and difficulties at its Indian power plant project.The stock has made steady progress this week as investors shopped for bargains or were encouraged by progress Enron made in its plan to divest itself of some overseas assets.On Wednesday, Enron announced the sale of some Indian oil and gas assets to BG Group PLC (BRG), a United Kingdom oil and gas company.J.P.

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) is looking to cut its workforce in Europe by up to 10%, or around 500 jobs, Enron Europe Chief Executive John Sherriff said Thursday."We have around 5,000 employees in Europe and we are seeking to cut our headcount here by between 5% and 10%, but we will aim as far as possible to achieve this through a program of voluntary severance," Sherriff replied in a written response to questions by Dow Jones Newswires.The cuts are the first significant retrenchment by Enron since it arrived in Europe in 1989.Enron has been the most aggressive U.S. energy company to expand into Europe's deregulating markets, but its core energy trading businesses have been held back by the slow and piecemeal progress toward market liberalization in the E.U.  The company declined to be more specific about how far it will scale back individual product lines or coverage of certain geographical businesses.Enron's product range in Europe has mushroomed over the past year, continually giving rise to market talk, notably among its competitors, of overstretching itself prematurely in underdeveloped markets."Enron's business continues to grow in Europe in terms of traded volumes and numbers of transactions, but like any company we are constantly seeking ways to do more with less in order to maintain earnings growth," Sherriff said."It is prudent for us to keep both a close eye on our costs and to continually review the skills and resources that are available to use, to ensure that they are deployed in a way to maximize earnings," he added.While trading volumes have exploded in core markets such as U.K. power trading since wholesale market reforms were introduced in March, liquidity in other products such as bandwidth, monomers and credit risk, is understood to have developed more slowly and restricted the volume growth needed to justify Enron's pure trading strategy.Enron has been among the most prominent exponents of a new philosophy in energy markets that places far more emphasis on risk management skills than the physical ownership of assets, a radical change from the asset-heavy approach to energy that prevailed in Europe before the E.U.'s deregulation directive came into effect in 1999.As such, it has in the last 18 months disposed of assets such as its stake in Sutton Bridge power station in England and has conspicuously refrained from buying 'brownfield' physical assets in markets such as Italy and Germany.However, it has pursued various greenfield independent power projects and the acquisition of gas trading licenses in markets such as Spain and Italy.-By Geoffrey T.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Select Energy Inc.'s planned purchase of Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing Inc. will speed up by a year or two the company's plans to expand its business beyond New England to the entire Northeast, Select's president said.The acquisition stengthens Select Energy's position in New York and the Mid-Atlantic, boosting its efforts to become a regional leader in the business of managing energy supply for industrial and commercial customers and trading electricity in the region."We want to be the dominant player here," President William Schivley said in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires."By being the dominant player in the Northeast, we'll be considered a national player."  Select, a unit of Berlin, Connecticut-based Northeast Utilities (NU), faces competition from national heavyweights like Enron Corp. (ENE), Duke Energy (DUK), AES Corp. (AES) and Exelon Corp. (EXC).Select Energy announced an agreement Tuesday to purchase the wholesale and retail energy sales unit of Syracuse, New York-based Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc. (NMK), which is active in the Mid-Atlantic and New York power markets.Integration plans aren't firm, but Select Energy will work with Niagara Mohawk executives to identify best practices from both companies, Schivley said.The companies aim to have a transition plan ready by the time federal energy regulators rule on the combination.Select Energy has said it plans to keep Niagara Mohawk's Syracuse office open.The company won't release the terms of the deal until it closes, which is expected in late November.Select has annual revenues of about $2.5 billion.Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing had revenues of $635 million in 2000.Select Energy is still looking at further acquisitions of trading operation and generating assets in New York and the Mid-Atlantic, Schivley said."This is more than just window shopping," Schivley said."We are actively seeking out hard assets."  The company isn't interested, however, in the two other unregulated units Niagara Mohawk is looking to sell in advance of its acquisition by National Grid Group PLC (NGG), he added.Within the next three to five years, more and more large companies are likely to start outsourcing management of their energy needs, especially as those needs become more complicated, Schivley said.Energy, along with labor and raw materials, are companies' three biggest expenses, he said."We're trying to grow this business by leaps and bounds," Schivley said."We've taken a giant step in New York. All the products we offer will be expanded dramatically and increased to a number that, without the acquisition, would have taken us a year or two to get to."  -By Kristen McNamara, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2061; kristen.mcnamara@dowjones.com  Copyright ?2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Pacific NW Lawmakers Gear Up To Oppose FERC RTO Mandate By Bryan Lee  10/04/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES   WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Members of the Pacific Northwest congressional delegation are gearing up in opposition to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's mandate for consolidation of power-grid assets in the region.The House Northwest Energy Caucus held an informal hearing late Wednesday to air concerns of utilities and industrial consumers in the region about FERC's effort to establish a regional transmission organization, or RTO.The lawmakers plan to follow up the hearing with a letter to FERC voicing the concerns, which largely revolve around skepticism that the RTO will result in cost savings for the region's consumers.FERC shouldn't force an RTO on the region without first conducting a cost-benefit analysis, said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., who is spearheading the effort.Speaking with reporters prior to Wednesday's hearing, DeFazio complained that "a bunch of bureaucrats" at FERC are embracing the national power-grid agenda of Enron Corp. (ENE) without assessing the costs and regardless of "what it does for local reliability."  DeFazio's complaints were echoed in the testimony presented at Wednesday's hearing.The region already enjoys an open and competitive transmission network, thanks to the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration, according to hearing testimony expressing concern that RTO West, as the RTO proposed for the region is called, will cost more to implement than it will provide in benefits."We are troubled that RTO West will not achieve any net benefit for end-use consumers in the Northwest," the Public Power Council testified."Although work is beginning on a cost-benefit study, we are troubled that a transmission system that has served us all well for so long will be disassembled because FERC has announced that RTOs, by definition, are good."  "Regional transmission organizations may be necessary to remedy the transmission ills in other regions of the country, but not in the Northwest," declared a group of transmission-dependent utilities."The 'balkanization' and isolation of transmission systems that characterize most other regions is simply not present in the Northwest. For this reason, the economic power-side benefits of an RTO will be relatively small," said a group of aluminum producers.Similar cost-benefit concerns have been voiced by state utility regulators in the Eastern U.S. who oppose FERC's effort to consolidate grid assets under large RTOs in the Southeast and Northeast.'RTO Week'   FERC Chairman Pat Wood III acknowledged the complaints Thursday, adding that he expected to address the concerns of regulators and industry during "RTO Week" Oct. 15, when the commission will hold five days of hearings on the commission's RTO mandate."I think I need the decisionmakers at the table. We've had the lawyers in the suits arguing about it for eight years now," Wood said at an "energy community" forum sponsored by Enron in Arlington, Va.Wood told Dow Jones Newswires following his remarks at the Enron forum that FERC answered the complaints about the lack of a cost-benefit analysis at its Sept. 26 meeting.The commission agreed to undertake a comprehensive analysis in support of its claim that RTOs will bring about operational efficiencies that will translate into consumer savings.Wood also noted a study by Mirant Corp. (MIR), which concluded that combining the three independent system operators in the Northeast into a single RTO would produce $440 million in annual consumer benefits.During the Enron forum, Edward Meyers, a regulator with the District of Columbia Public Service Commission, urged Wood to seek out the input of affected state regulators.Meyers noted that he is in the minority among regulators in the region in supporting the Northeast RTO grid-consolidation, while most others oppose the effort as "economically dangerous."  Arnetta McRae, chairman of the Delaware Public Service Commission, told Wood that her fellow state regulators aren't so much opposed to grid regionalization but the lack of consultation by FERC.The state regulators want "an opportunity to be at the table," McRae said.If such a process were offered, there would be a lot less opposition, she predicted.FERC is reaching out to address the concerns of state regulators, Wood said, adding that he was "blindsided" by the opposition among state regulators to FERC's grid-consolidation mandate.Later in the day, Wood told reporters that "RTO Week" will feature an entire hearing devoted to the concerns of state regulators.At the Enron forum, Wood defended the commission's RTO policy, which calls for carving up the nation's interconnected electricity system under the control of four or five large RTOs, as necessary to jump-start the overly long transition from regulation to competition."This process needs to be goosed," said Wood, calling FERC's RTO orders "an external catalyst" to get the process moving."If I'm wrong, I'd love to find a better way around that," he said.-By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647; Bryan.Lee@dowjones.com  Copyright ?2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.USA: NewPower signs up 50,000 new electric users in Texas.10/04/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The New Power Co. said Thursday the electricity grid operator in Texas is processing requests from over 50,000 residential customers who have chosen New Power as their new electricity provider.The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) is responsible for processing the requests to switch customers for all utilities and competitive retail electric service providers during the state's deregulation pilot program, NewPower said in a statement.The switching process could take anywhere from two weeks to two months before consumers will actually begin to receive power from a competitive retail electricity provider.New Power said it has captured more than half of the customers who decided to switch to new providers from the Reliant Energy HL&P and TXU Corp. markets.The New Power Co., a subsidiary of NewPower Holdings, Inc., is the first national provider of electricity and natural gas to residential and small commercial customers in deregulated power markets in the United States.The Texas pilot power deregulation program began on July 31 after it was delayed two months due to computer problems.The entire state is slated to begin full retail competition on Jan. 1, 2002.A spokesman for the Public Utility Commission of Texas told Reuters previously that about 120,000 residential customers had signed up for the pilot program.Copyright ?2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.States protest federal involvement in electricity competition, deregulation By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer  10/04/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001.The Associated Press.All Rights Reserved.WASHINGTON (AP) - North Carolina and several other states told the Supreme Court the government went too far when it ordered electric utilities to open their power lines to competitors and spurred a movement toward deregulation.But one of the country's largest power marketers, Enron, argued before the court Wednesday that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should have gone even further to help companies like Enron get equal access to power grids.During the hourlong hearing, the justices gave little indication of how they will decide on a case that could dramatically affect management of the nation's power grids and the future of electricity competition.At one point, Justice Stephen Breyer said FERC, which regulates wholesale power markets and interstate transmission of power, was being "whipsawed" from both directions.The commission's 1996 decision, which for the first time required traditional utilities to open their transmission lines to competing power merchants, triggered a movement toward wholesale electricity competition and led numerous states to end monopolies in retail power markets.But utility regulators in nine states, led by New York, filed suit arguing that the FERC order amounts to a federal agency attempting to regulate retail sales, usurping a traditional state function.At the same time, Enron's lawsuit charged that FERC violated federal law because it did not require access to transmission lines when utilities continued to keep transmission and retail sales as one operation - as remains the case in many states that have yet to allow competition.In June 2000, an appellate court essentially upheld FERC's regulation, prompting appeals from both Enron and the state regulators."It's an example of where an agency has overstepped its bounds," Lawrence Malone, general counsel for the New York State Public Service Commission, told the justices at Wednesday's hearing.The other states party to the lawsuit are Florida, Idaho, New Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia, Washington, Vermont and Wyoming.Malone, appearing on behalf of all nine states, argued that FERC's order pre-empts state authority to regulate retail sales and set rates."This case isn't about rates," countered Louis Cohen, representing Enron Power Marketing Inc. before the court."What we're concerned about is getting onto the (grid) system."  Cohen said that under the current access rules a dominant utility in a state that has not moved to competition may still "hog" the lines and keep Enron and similar marketers from moving power across a region.The Justice Department, representing FERC before the court, argued that the commission only sought to strike a balance between the need to give competitors equal access to power lines and leaving retail market issues to the states.Edwin Kneedler, deputy solicitor general, told the court that FERC, in his view, could have gone further, as Enron has argued.But, he said, to do so it would first have had to order all utilities to separate retail sales and transmission, something it chose to leave to the states.The case, which is not expected to be decided until sometime next year, comes at a time of growing concern about electricity competition and power grid reliability in light of recent power problems in California.About half of the states have taken some steps toward retail electricity competition.Many power industry experts as well as the FERC commissioners have emphasized that a truly competitive electricity market will be difficult to achieve without smooth and efficient flow of electricity across large regions, if not nationally.And that, argue companies like Enron who want to compete with traditional utilities, will require more open access to transmission.In an attempt to smooth the flow of power, FERC has embarked on a campaign to establish four large, regional transmission organizations to manage the national power grid.A court decision rolling back some of FERC's authority over open access to transmission lines could affect that effort.Uncertainty over how far the federal government will be allowed to go in requiring transmission access also could affect state decisions on whether to embrace electricity competition, according to some industry experts.---  On the Net:  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission: http://www.ferc.fed.us/  Enron: http://www.enron.com/corp/  Copyright ?2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.",0,0,0

373,"Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats.The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com.We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname).Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format.It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com.For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards.If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks.Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format.If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.Enron Messaging Administration",1,0,1

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES   WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Any merger deal that may emerge between Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Enron Corp. (ENE) will face a complicated and time-consuming regulatory-review process, legal experts said Thursday.Any equity deal would require approvals from numerous U.S. federal regulatory agencies and state utility regulators, as well as survive Canadian and European antitrust reviews, energy attorneys contacted by Dow Jones Newswires said.A merger would require approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission.And the Illinois Commerce Commission likely would weigh into the mix, since Dynegy owns Illinova's Illinois Power Co.Any effort to strike a deal quickly also could be complicated by Enron's ownership of Portland General Electric Co.While Enron has entered into an agreement to sell the utility to Northwest Natural Gas Co. (NWN), a previous attempt to sell the company fell through because of regulatory complications.A key issue for federal regulators scrutinizing a potential Enron-Dynegy merger will be the degree of electricity market concentration such a transaction would entail, the attorneys said.Financially wounded Enron is the nation's largest electricity and natural gas trader with an extensive network of gas pipelines.Dynegy is ranked sixth nationally in both electricity and natural gas marketing.The transaction would receive the greatest scrutiny at FERC, where the merger application would challenge the commission's merger-review policy, attorneys said.Copyright ?2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.US Physical Gas Prices Mostly Down; No Demand  11/08/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices mostly fell Thursday, dipping on low demand and a shorter-than-usual trading session as Enron's online trading service went off the board, traders said.With Dynegy and Enron Corp. talking takeover matters, traders felt Enron's gas traders simply covered positions and got out of the market quickly.Marketers felt Enron's trading positions have eased in the last two weeks as the company reported a $1.2 billion erosion of investor equity related to questionable partnerships.Also, traders pointed to no incremental or storage demand and a lack of weather-driving prices downward.Fundamentals for the market remain bearish: Storage is near all-time highs, and injection season ended with Wednesday's 10 billion cubic feet build.Otherwise, some floor traders said gas marketers were shying away from trading with giant Enron Corp.December settled Thursday at $2.960 per million British thermal units, up 9.0 cents.Traders are looking ahead hopefully to colder weather at the end of the month, in time for the Thanksgiving holiday.At the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana, traders paid $2.60-$2.77/MMBtu, down 1 cent-8 cents.First-of-month November index is $3.16/MMBtu, traders said.Deals at Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Station No. 65 were done at $2.60-$2.74/MMBtu, down 5 cents-8 cdents.November first-of-month index is $3.19/MMBtu, a trader said.At the Arizona-California Border, where gas from El Paso's pipeline begins delivery to Southern California, buyers paid $2.54-$2.65/MMBtu, up 1 cent on the bid, down 2 cents on the offer as traders feared curtailments on the pipeline.November first-of-month index is $2.95/MMBtu.At the Katy hub in East Texas, buyers paid $2.56-$2.74/MMBtu, down 7 cents on the bid, up 3 cents on the offer.November index is $3.01/MMBtu, a trader said Thursday.At Waha in West Texas, buyers paid $2.44-$2.57/MMBtu, down 3 cents on the bid, up 1 cent on the offer.November index is $2.86/MMBtu.-By John Edmiston, Dow Jones Newswires,713-547-9209; john.edmiston@dowjones.com    Copyright ?2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.USA: NewPower shares advance on revised guidance.11/08/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - National power and gas marketer NewPower Holdings Inc. revised its 2001 loss guidance downward on Thursday and saw its stock post its best one-day gain in two months.The projection came in NewPower's report of a third quarter net loss of $67.1 million, or $1.15 per share, compared to a net loss of $69.9 million, or $2.96 per share for the third quarter of 2000.Analysts had expected a per-share loss of $1.15 to $1.18, according to research firm Thomson Financial/First Call, which put the consensus at $1.16.Purchase, New York-based NewPower is the parent of The New Power Co., which says it is the first national provider of electricity and natural gas to residential and small commercial customers in the United States.It said total customers increased 155 percent to 805,000 compared to the third quarter of 2000.Revenues were $54.7 million in the latest quarter, an increase of 201 percent from the third quarter of 2000.During the third quarter, NewPower said, it gained about 80,000 new customers through the company's marketing efforts, primarily in the residential sector.NewPower recently increased its emphasis on small business customers and at the end of September had over 25,000 small business accounts.NewPower expects this to increase to more than 35,000 by the end of the year.Providing revised guidance for the rest of the year, the company said it expects a net loss of $41 million to $46 million or a loss per share of 65 cents to 73 cents for the fourth quarter.The full year net loss is estimated to be between $210 million and $215 million, or $3.55 to $3.63 per share.Analysts' estimates of the year per share loss range from $3.68 to $3.74, resulting in a consensus per share loss projection of $3.71.NewPower said it projects the year-end customer count will be between 840,000 and 860,000, of which the fourth-quarter increase is expected to be achieved entirely through marketing.It said the revised forecast reflects a reduction in the number of customers the company expects to acquire through portfolio acquisitions and the impact of delays in switching Texas customers to NewPower, partly offset by the company's modified marketing strategies and continued cost reductions.NewPower shares reached a high of $1.25 in Thursday afternoon trading and were still up 48.15 percent, or 39 cents, at $1.20 in the final half hour of trading.The company is 44 percent owned by Enron Corp., NewPower's largest provider of electricity and natural gas.Copyright ?2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Enron Investors Still Perplexed - And Stock Shows It By Christina Cheddar Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  11/08/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Even as more facts are revealed regarding Enron Corp.'s (ENE) financial dealings, investors can agree: Things remain as clear as mud.Earlier Thursday, Enron and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) confirmed the neighboring rivals were talks for a potential "business combination."An agreement hasn't been reached yet, and neither company will make any further comment until a contract is signed or the talks end.Separately, Enron restated its earnings from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001.As the news hit the tape, Enron shares, after being briefly halted, seemed to hunt for a direction.The stock traded as high as $10, and as low as $8.40.Currently, the shares were at $8.67, down 38 cents, or 4.2%.Wednesday, the shares zigzagged.Meanwhile, Dynegy shares, which had fallen Wednesday as news of the talks began to leak out, regained lost ground and then added some.Dynegy shares were recently trading up $4.54, or 13.8%, at $37.54."There's a lot of news to digest," said Glen Hilton, a portfolio manager at San Francisco-based Montgomery Asset Management.Enron shares have been in a downward spiral since it revealed last month that the unwinding of off-balance sheet transaction with a partnership run by its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, had resulted in the loss of $1.2 billion in shareholder equity.That bad news led to more bad news, including the downgrades of its credit ratings, which are essential to the health of its core wholesale energy marketing and trading business.Meanwhile, investor confidence eroded as market watchers asked Enron to come clean.The move in Enron and Dynegy shares Thursday was unusual for companies considering a merger.Typically, shares of the acquirer will fall, while shares of the target climb.Investors explained the move several ways.Some said it was a reflection of the lack of a premium Enron shareholders will be paid.Their views were based on a report in The Wall Street Journal, which cited a source familiar with the matter who said Dynegy is considering paying $7 billion to $8 billion in stock, or about one-tenth of what Enron was worth 15 months ago.Others agreed, and said given recent events they're being cautious.Larry Alberts, a buy-side analyst at American Express Financial Advisors, said he was questioning how serious Dynegy is about the transaction.He also said there is still the possibility of more bad news to come from Enron.As for the restatement of earnings going back to 1997, investors said it was clearly having a negative impact on Enron's stock even though some had been expecting it.John Waterman, of Rittenhouse Financial Services, said the information Enron disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission was "hard to sort through."  Waterman said he was encouraged that the restatement didn't reflect any revenue recognition issues, and it still showed that there was growth in the business - albeit not as much as previously reported.Enron had to restate the earnings because it should have included three of its off-balance sheet financing vehicles - Chewco Investments LP, Joint Energy Development Investments LP, or JEDI, and a unit of LJM Cayman LP - in its consolidated financial statements under the guidelines of generally accepted accounting principles.Revelations about the involvement of Enron's Fastow in LJM are at the center of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and led to demands from the financial community that he be terminated.On Wednesday, Enron disclosed it has fired its treasurer, Ben Glisan, and its general counsel, Kristina Mordaunt, as well.Gilsan, Mordaunt, and two former Enron employees were partners of LJM while serving at Enron.Enron continues to say it had controls in place relating to Fastow's involvement with the partnerships.The board required review and approval of each transaction by the office of the chairman, the chief accounting officer and the chief risk officer.Whether these controls and procedures were followed will be investigated by a special committee Enron has named.Many expect that if Enron remains independent, more executive departures could be in store."The bottom line from my perspective is that Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, and the board seemed to be aware (of Fastow's dealings with the LJM partnerships)," said Andre Meade, an analyst at Commerzebanc Securities."Everyone's hands are dirty, including Ken Lay. ... The firing the CFO and treasurer are not going to single-handedly solve the problems at Enron," he continued.Others also are questioning the role of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditor."People like us have to rely on people like them," said Rittenhouse's Waterman.According to its restated financial information, Enron had close to $13 billion in debt at Sept. 30.Liquidity issues remain the chief concern among investors, who continue to fret that the latest disclosure will result in a further deterioration of Enron's credit rating."The clock is ticking on Enron," said Montgomery's Hilton."Each day brings a new piece of incremental news."  Following the release of Enron's earnings last month, Hilton had a hunch the company would likely write off additional investments as it had in the third quarter.However, he was committed to the stock, and at the time he didn't plan to sell his stake, which accounted for 2% of the close to $100 million in assets he manages.Since that time, Hilton has sold his Enron stock.He said he began selling after news of the SEC probe broke."It just got too scary to hold," he said.Still, Hilton, who owns shares of Dynegy as well, isn't concerned about the possibility of a merger of the two Houston energy traders."It's David taking Goliath," he said, adding that he is convinced that Dynegy's management will not enter into a transaction that will threaten the company's stability.Several Dynegy investors echoed Hilton's sentiment with their own expressions of confidence in Dynegy's management.However, at times these convictions were almost betrayed by a nervousness brought on by the sense that what one doesn't know could be hurtful.Some investors remain concerned by Dynegy's motivation.According to Hilton, investors don't know what would happen to the market - and as a result, to Dynegy - if Enron fails.So, what reason truly is motivating Dynegy?"It's probably both," Hilton speculated.-By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires;

Salomon Smith Barney, Barclays Capital and Morgan Stanley arranged the sale.Copyright ?2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.USA: WRAPUP 1-Enron, Dynegy confirm possible merger talks.By Jeff Franks  11/08/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.HOUSTON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., plagued by investor doubts and under the gun to shore up its crumbling finances, said on Thursday it was talking with power trading rival Dynegy Inc. about a possible merger.The company, whose stock and credit ratings have plummeted amid an uproar about questionable business transactions, admitted it made bookkeeping errors and restated earnings for the last four years.It also said former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who abruptly left the company last month, had made $30 million managing partnerships linked to the deals.The deals, which were off the balance sheet, are now under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for possible conflict of interest.Two other executives, managing director and treasurer Ben Glisan and Enron division general counsel Kristina Mordaunt, were both believed to have links to the Fastow-led partnerships and have been fired, the company disclosed.The announcements threw a spotlight on Enron's stark situation, in which the nation's top energy trader has gone from Wall Street darling to pariah in a few weeks and now faces a cash crunch so dire it is seeking a merger with the much-smaller Dynegy.Its credit ratings have fallen to near-junk levels in recent weeks, making it difficult to get money to boost investor confidence and back the trading operations that provide 90 percent of Enron's income.The company reportedly has been seeking investors to provide a cash infusion for an equity stake.MODERATE PREMIUM  Word about a possible Dynegy-Enron deal leaked out on Wednesday, and on Thursday the two companies confirmed talks about a possible "business combination" were underway, but said no agreement had been reached.Sources told Reuters that the two Texas rivals, whose headquarters are a few blocks apart in downtown Houston, were talking about a stock swap with a moderate premium for shareholders and a $1.5 billion capital infusion from ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26.5 percent of Dynegy.The stock swap is valued at about $8 billion, or about $10 a share, The New York Times reported on Thursday.A merger would catapult Dynegy to the top of the energy trading industry now dominated by Enron.Last year, the company had $29 billion in revenues, compared to $100 billion for Enron.For Enron, it would cap an astonishingly rapid fall from grace.Enron stock has lost $19 billion in market value since its crisis began in mid-October and was down another 45 cents to $8.60 in Thursday trading.Dynegy shares rose $3.87 to $36.87.Enron restated its earnings going back to 1997, saying its auditors advised that the off-the-balance sheet deals in question should have been included in the company's financial statements.The restated results reduced Enron's net income by $591 million, or 22 percent, from 1997 to 2000, and increased its debt by $628 million, or 6 percent, after two of the partnership's financial statements were consolidated into Enron's earnings.Enron said the restatement reflects a $1.2 billion reduction to shareholders' equity that touched off the current controversy when the company offhandedly disclosed it last month.Angry shareholders suddenly worried that Enron was hiding other liabilities in its complex financial statements and began demanding more information.In a statement, Enron chief executive Ken Lay said the company hoped it had allayed Wall Street fears with Thursday's announcements."We believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about these matters," he said.Analysts, wary after last month's surprise revelations, said Enron may have more to release, but they were pleased it was finally coming forth with information."It's an attempt to come clean," said Raymond Moore, an analyst with Weatherly Securities.Copyright ?2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.IN THE MONEY: Enron Transparency Not Transparent Enough By Michael Rapoport  11/08/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) A Dow Jones Newswires Column   NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- So Enron Corp. (ENE) says it wants to be more transparent - to make its impenetrable financial results and corporate structure easier for investors and analysts to understand.Based on its announcements Thursday, however, it still has a heck of a long way to go.With Enron's restatement Thursday of nearly five years' worth of earnings and additional information about the maze of off-balance-sheet deals related to it, we now have a lot more information about the mess at Enron than we had 24 hours ago.But we're not much closer to understanding just what HAPPENED to leave Enron in such a mess - and that's because the company's explanations of all this continue to be dense, confusing and next to impossible to grasp.Try this tidbit, from the Form 8-K Enron filed about the restatements Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission:  "In addition, Enron's net income is reduced for specific JEDI revenues previously allocated to Chewco, relating to the appreciation in value of Enron stock, which eliminate upon consolidation. This, in effect, reduces Enron's share of JEDI's earnings."  Huh?And no, it doesn't help you to know that "Chewco" is an entity that wasn't included in Enron's financial results but which Enron now admits should have been.Or that "JEDI" isn't a "Star Wars" reference but a limited partnership in which both Enron and Chewco had invested.It's still impenetrable.Then there are the times when Enron just plain doesn't give enough information.The company says its decision that Chewco should be included in its results after all "is based on current information that Chewco did not meet the accounting criteria to qualify as ... unconsolidated..."Uh - okay.WHY didn't it meet the criteria, and why did Enron previously believe that it did?Enron doesn't say.Finally, Enron makes some assertions that just make you scratch your head.The company says part of the restatement of its earnings stems from unspecified "prior-year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications which were determined to be immaterial in the year originally proposed."  Hmmm.Beyond the fact that Enron doesn't elaborate on the nature of these "audit adjustments and reclassifications," or why they were originally considered immaterial, consider that according to Enron's own figures in the 8-K, they add up to a negative earnings impact of $87 million since 1997.That amount doesn't sound like any definition of "immaterial" I've ever heard.An Enron spokesman couldn't immediately be reached for comment.In fairness, this lack of clarity may be all but inevitable given Enron's Byzantine structure, which involves dealings with outside but related entities that also have third parties involved, which in one case have a subsidiary that allowed Enron to hedge the risks of an investment, and in another case is selling assets purchased from Enron to OTHER entities in order to finish paying Enron for the original transaction, and ... you get the idea.It's next to impossible to make clear because Enron's structure is just too baroque to understand in the first place.The market is plenty puzzled by all this, even in the wake of Enron's attempt to clarify things.Take a look at the company's drunken-sailor stock chart from Thursday.After news of the restatements hit, Enron stock first jumped higher, going as high as $10 a share, then soon dropped back, to as low as $8.40, as investors started to digest the details of the news.Then up again to about $9.25, then down again to its current level of around $8.50.There's no reason investors should be confused like this.There is absolutely no reason that a reasonably intelligent layman, with an elementary working knowledge of corporate finance, should be unable to understand the regulatory filings, structure, earnings and balance sheet of any public company.If that happens, it's the company's fault, not the investor's - either because the company hasn't explained things well enough or because its structure is needlessly complicated to begin with.If Enron wants to get back the market's confidence, fixing that problem, one way or the other, would be a good place to start.-By Michael Rapoport, Dow Jones Newswires;

CIBC World Markets analyst William Hyler, who rates Enron 'Buy', added: "The move would also catapult (Dynergy) into a leadership role at what could prove near the bottom of the gas/power pricing cycle."  On the other hand, Enron's position would improve as its credibility within the trading world and in the face of its trading counterparties would recover somewhat.To that end, Dynergy would provide a yet unspecified cash injection, believed to be approximately 1.5-2.0 bln usd, to improve Enron's standing and shore up its finances.ChevronTexaco, which is expected to provide a substantial part of the financing needed for the merger, also stands to gain from the situation as it would retain effective control of the combined company.rdc/lj  For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com    Copyright ?2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.US Spot Coal: Prices Weaken As Buying For 2002 Slows  11/08/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Coal prices slumped in physical markets last week, as mild weather in the East, a slowing economy and high utility inventories undercut demand, sources said Wednesday.Over-the-counter prices for Central Appalachian barges for calendar year 2002 slid $1.75 from last week to $32.00 a ton on Tuesday, trading several times at that level, people in the market said.With major coal producers sold out for the remainder of this year and most of next year, traders said, prices could move higher if there were a sudden rise in demand."Utilities are comfortable in their stockpiles, a trader said. "The only thing that would make this market bounce a little bit would be some cold weather in the East."  The cut in Enron Corp's (ENE) credit rating and a Security and Exchange Commission investigation into its transactions with off-balance-sheet partnerships was making the energy giant's coal customers anxious about getting paid, people in the market said. A coal broker said counterparties were watching Enron's credit and limiting longer-term business with the company.  "Everyone is nervous," a buyer at a Midwestern utility said.  Major coal producers and coal-burning utilities interviewed by Dow Jones Newswires on Wednesday said they hadn't suspended trading with Enron.  Physical prices were largely unaffected by the turmoil in the trading business and continued the downward trend that began in mid-October.  In the East, where prices softened in light trade, Central Appalachian barge deals for November delivery to the Big Sandy River were done in late October as low as $30.75 free on board, down from $33.50 a ton. December and the first quarter of 2002 traded several times Tuesday at $32.00 and $32.25 a ton, down $1.50 since late October.  Rail deliveries were pegged between $36.00 and $38.00 a ton FOB. No deals were confirmed.  In the West, Powder River Basin coal with a heat rate of 8,800 British thermal units slipped to $7.55 a ton for November, down a nickel since late October. Deals for calendar year 2002 were done at $8.10 and $8.15 a ton, down about 10 cents.  PRB 8,400 Btu coal traded very little, sources said. November deliveries deals were done at $5.90 a ton, down from $6.25 a ton at the end of October. Calendar year 2002 was pegged between $6.35 and $6.45 a ton, down 10 cents.  According to the Energy Information Agency, total U.S. coal production through Oct. 27, the latest date for which figures were available, ticked upward by 445,000 short tons to 21.8 million tons.  Appalachian coal production, year to date, was 2% ahead of last year. Total Appalachian production in 2001 is 356,557 tons, up from 349,711 tons in the same period last year.  U.S. Western coal production year to date remains steady at 6.4% ahead of 2000 figures. EIA reports total western coal production through Oct. 27 at 447,308 tons, up from 420,353 tons in the year-earlier period.  Railcar loadings through the end of October were 5% higher than comparable 2000 figures, according the EIA.  Activity on the New York Mercantile Exchange, which came to virtual standstill last week, picked up on Tuesday. On Tuesday, open interest for the December coal contract was at 217.

STOCKWATCH Dynergy sharply higher, Enron flat on merger talks  11/08/2001 AFX News (c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Dynergy Inc were sharply higher, while Enron Corp continued to lose ground, in midsession trading after the two companies confirmed that they are holding merger talks.  At 12.25 pm, Dynergy was up 3.17 usd, or 9.6 pct, at 36.17, Enron fell 0.34 usd, or 3.7 pct, to 8.71 usd and ChevronTexaco dropped 0.18 usd to 87.10. The DJIA was up 110.22 points at 9,664.59, the S&P 500 index gained 12.88 points to 1,128.68 and the Nasdaq composite rose 34.35 points to 1,871.88. Enron share price today was hurt after the company announced a restatement of its net income from 1997 to the third quarter of 2001. The revisions were, for the most part, reductions in the bottom-line figure.  The 8 bln usd tie-up talks, which come at a time when Enron is being investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the markets are losing faith in the energy trader, are seen as particularly positive for Dynergy.  Analysts see a tie-up as highly accretive for Dynergy, which is 26 pct owned by ChevronTexaco, with many synergies also possible.  Banc of America analyst William Maze, who rates Dynergy 'Strong Buy', said: "If this transaction comes to fruition, we would be aggressive buyers of Dynergy given its accretive nature as well as the lifting of Enron's credibility issues that has been plaguing the entire industry."  CIBC World Markets analyst William Hyler, who rates Enron 'Buy', added: "The move would also catapult (Dynergy) into a leadership role at what could prove near the bottom of the gas/power pricing cycle."  On the other hand, Enron's position would improve as its credibility within the trading world and in the face of its trading counterparties would recover somewhat.  To that end, Dynergy would provide a yet unspecified cash injection, believed to be approximately 1.5-2.0 bln usd, to improve Enron's standing and shore up its finances.  ChevronTexaco, which is expected to provide a substantial part of the financing needed for the merger, also stands to gain from the situation as it would retain effective control of the combined company.  rdc/lj  For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - U.S. energy trading giant Enron Corp. , whose shares have tumbled amid a regulatory probe and doubts about its ability to raise cash, may lose or offload its metals business, senior industry sources said on Thursday.  In the wings are several interested parties looking to snap up the company's metals customer base. "There are people out there with the experience and the contacts who see this time as a good opportunity to get into the market," a senior metals market source told Reuters on Thursday.  Such a move for Enron's metals portfolio would involve the acquisition of an existing organisation as a vehicle, the source added.  "We do not comment on rumours," an Enron spokeswoman said, declining further comment.  Other Enron Metals assets were also said to be in play, including the Henry Bath warehousing company, which operates LME-registered warehouses in the UK, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United States.  MAJOR PLAYER  Houston-based Enron became a major player in the metals trade in May last year when it acquired MG plc, a leading independent international metals dealing firm in London, in a deal worth around 300 million pounds.  The company is a ring-dealing member of the London Metal Exchange (LME), able to participate in open-outcry floor trade, and is active in screen-based metals trade via its EnronOnline platform (www.enrononline.com).  The company no longer has a stake in online metals trading platform EMETRA (www.emetra.com), having sold its holding to other EMETRA shareholders this summer.  But while Enron may be a heavy hitter in the metals sector, base metals trading could hardly be regarded as one of its core businesses.  The company's third-quarter 2001 results statement shows income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) from "Europe and other commodity markets" - which includes metals and steel alongside European gas and power, among others - of $53 million, unchanged from the year-earlier period.  This compares with IBIT from Enron's gas and power market-making operations and merchant energy activities in North and South America of $710 million over the same period.  But the third-quarter figure that has slashed the value of the company's shares is a $1.2 billion write-down of shareholder equity related to off-balance sheet transactions.  On Thursday the company said it would restate its earnings for 1997 to 2001 to reflect the transactions - a move which wipes $613 million of the company's reported net income from 1997 through the first half of this year.  The company's stock has dropped by almost 78 percent since Enron released its earnings results on October 16, falling to nine-year lows amid concerns about the company's ability to raise cash.  The story added an extra twist on Wednesday as news broke that U.S.-based energy trading and marketing firm Dynegy Inc. was in talks to buy out Enron.  Against this background speculation is rife about the future of the metals operation, fuelled by the company's decision last month to trim between 10 and 20 percent of its metals workforce as part of a wider staff reduction by Enron Europe.  UNLIKELY TO REMAIN INTACT  Any decision by Enron or a possible future purchaser to offload its metals operations would be unlikely to see Enron Metals remain intact, traders said.  "They paid $450 million for MG.Would they get $450 million for Enron Metals?I don't think so," said one.  "Why buy the whole concern when you can cherry-pick the best traders and the clients will follow?" added another.  An increasing emphasis on screen trading at the expense of personal contacts may already have persuaded some Enron clients to jump ship.  "We've picked up a fair amount of small and mid-sized trade-type business in Europe from people who've said 'I'm not going to be told just to trade on a screen,'" said one trader.  Another trader said: "A lot of this business revolves around who you've been trading with and talking to over a period of time.It's about individuals," he said.  "Enron Online...should be seen as an 'added value' product, not as the only way of trading.Customers still want to talk to their broker, and are willing to pay commission for the service," the senior source said.  Enron's financial position could also prompt customers to consider other options, the first trader said.  "As a customer, you want to place your business where there's financial stability.If a company isn't financially stable, you'll move elsewhere."  Enron's trade counterparties are also keeping a close eye on the company's financial situation, said a trader at one LME brokerage.  "People aren't particularly concerned about short-term trading (with Enron), but when it comes to OTC business done outside the clearing market they're backing off a bit," he said.

WRAP: Enron To Restate Results; Confirms Dynegy Talks  11/08/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) said it will restate its financial results from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001, as the embattled energy company and Dynegy Inc. both confirmed they are in talks on a possible business combination.  In a filing Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Enron said its financial and audit reports are unreliable for those periods. Enron said that three "unconsolidated entities should have been included in its consolidated financial statements," based on generally accepted accounting principles. These entities are Chewco Investments LP, Joint Energy Development Investments LP and a wholly owned unit of LJM Cayman LP.  Enron said it has established a special committee to review all transactions. The committee will specifically review all "economic results" related to transactions between Enron and LJM.  Last month Enron took a $1.01 billion charge in the third quarter related to write-downs of investments. Of this, $35 million was attributed to partnerships run until recently by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who has since been replaced. Enron also disclosed it shrank shareholder equity by $1.2 billion, as a result of several transactions including ones undertaken with Fastow's investment vehicle.  Later, Enron said the SEC would investigate the company's "related party transactions," including those with the Fastow partnerships.  The restatement will reflect the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholders' equity, as well as various income-statement and balance-sheet adjustments determined by Enron and its auditors.  "We believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about these matters," said Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay  Over the past couple of days, Enron has been scrambling to line up quick financing from a prominent outside investor and has been in discussions with private-equity firms and power-trading companies.  Earlier, The Wall Street Journal reported that Dynegy was trying to buy Enron for $7 billion to $8 billion in stock. Both are Houston-based energy-trading and power companies.  Because any combination of the two would likely be scrutinized for many months, and Enron needs to shore up its finances now, Dynegy reportedly is expected to inject $1.5 billion into Enron immediately, people familiar with the matter said.  ChevronTexaco Corp. (CVX), which owns a 26% stake in Dynegy, is expected to provide Dynegy with the funds for the cash infusion and is playing a significant role in the negotiations, the Journal said.  The boards of Dynegy, Chevron and Enron reportedly met Wednesday to discuss a potential deal. Enron's stock has plunged since Oct. 16, when the company posted a $618 million third-quarter loss and revealed that its shareholder equity had been reduced.  The talks between Enron and Dynegy follow a sharp decline in Enron's stock over the past several weeks.    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	  USA: Enron fires two employees linked to partnerships.  11/08/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. , the embattled energy trader, said on Thursday fired its treasurer and a counsel who the company said were part-owners of one of its off-balance sheet partnerships now under investigation by U.S. regulators.  Enron said it was terminating the employment of Ben Glisan, managing director and treasurer of Enron Corp., and Kristina Mordaunt, a managing director and counsel of an Enron division. Enron said it believes that these two employees, along with four other former Enron employees, were involved as partners in a limited partnership called the LJM1 that had dealings with Enron.  Shares of Enron were trading down 5 cents or .55 percent at $9 on the New York Stock Exchange.    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	  Enron restates net income for periods from 1997 to Q3 2001  11/08/2001 AFX News (c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd HOUSTON (AFX) - Enron Corp announced it is restating its net results for 1997 to 2000 and for the first three quarters of 2001 to take account of various related party and off-balance sheet transactions in which the company was involved.  The restatement have no effect on Enron's current financial position, it said. In its restated figures, Enron posted reductions to net income of 96 mln usd in 1997, 113 mln usd in 1998, 250 mln in 1999 and 132 mln in 2000, as well as increases of 17 mln usd for the first quarter of 2001 and 5 mln for the second, but reduced the third quarter figure by 17 mln usd.  The restatement will have no negative impact on the company's reported earnings for the nine month period ending Sept 2001, however, it said.  The company said its changes to net income are the result of the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments LP and Chewco Investments LP beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of the LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  The JEDI and Chewco consolidations will increase Enron's debt by about 711 mln usd in 1997, 561 mln in 1998, 685 mln in 1999 and 628 mln in 2000, the company said.  kgd/jkm/ For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved. NEW YORK (AP) - Beleaguered energy trading giant Enron Corp. announced Thursday it would restate its earnings since 1997, in part to reflect a controversial dlrs 1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that has sparked a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.  Enron, whose stock price has fallen roughly 80 percent in the past three weeks, also said it was holding talks with Dynegy Inc. relating to some form of business transaction. The New York Times reported that Dynegy was considering buying Enron, its larger hometown rival for dlrs 8 billion. In a filing with the SEC, Enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 "should not be relied upon" and that partnerships run by Enron officials during that period should have been consolidated into the financial results of the Houston-based energy trading giant.  These partnerships are Chewco Investments L.P., Joint Energy Development Investments L.P., and a wholly owned unit of LJM Cayman L.P.  "We believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about these matters," said Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive.  By its own assessment, Enron's restatement reduces previously reported net income by roughly dlrs 586 million and increases its debt by dlrs 2.59 billion. The change reflects the financial impact of retroactively consolidating the partnerships.  The company also fired two executives on Thursday: Ben Glisan, its treasurer, and Kristina Mordaunt, general counsel for one of its divisions. Previously, Enron had ousted chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who was in charge of some of the partnerships.  Shares of Enron were off 10 cents to dlrs 8.95 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Enron said it believes the restatement will include a reduction to net income of about dlrs 96 million in 1997, dlrs 113 million in 1998, dlrs 250 million in 1999 and dlrs 132 million in 2000, increases of dlrs 17 million for the first quarter of 2001 and dlrs 5 million for the second quarter and a reduction of dlrs 17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  Enron, the top buyer and seller of natural gas and the top wholesale marketer in the United States, had become one of the nation's 10 largest companies, recording revenue of dlrs 100.8 billion in 2000.  But the company has been beset by huge investment losses and questions about its financial stability. In particular, its stock has plunged since Oct. 16, when the company posted a dlrs 618 million third quarter loss and revealed that its shareholder equity had been reduced.  Enron's woes have prompted considerable speculation about a possible takeover of the company.  Besides Dynegy, companies mentioned as possible suitors included General Electric's GE Capital unit and Royal Dutch/Shell Group.  On Thursday, both Dynegy and Enron released statements confirming they were in talks, but declined to provide any details.  The New York Times reported earlier that Dynegy is considering paying about dlrs 8 billion in stock, or roughly dlrs 10 per share.  Under the terms of the deal, Enron would receive an immediate dlrs 1.5 billion cash infusion from oil giant Chevron Texaco, which holds a 27 percent stake in Dynegy, the Times said, citing executives close to the discusssion.  Chevron Texaco would provide an additional dlrs 1 billion injection at a later date, the Times reported, while Dynegy would assume dlrs 12.8 billion in Enron debt, plus billions of dollars in other debt that has been kept off the beleaguered company's balance sheet and has been a significant contributor to its current problems.

HOUSTON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. said on Thursday it provided U.S. regulators with more information about off-balance sheet deals, and other transactions that led to a shattering of the company's credibility and to an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Enron, the once high-flying Houston-based energy trading company, also confirmed it was in talks with its hometown rival Dynegy Inc. over a possible business combination. Terms of any deal have not been agreed on, the two companies said. Enron said that it will restate its earnings from 1997 to 2000 and the first two quarters of 2001 as the company addresses concerns raised by the SEC and shareholders.  Shares of Enron dropped 20 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $8.85 in Thursday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Enron, the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in North America, said the required restatement reflects the surprising - and controversial - $1.2 billion reduction to shareholders' equity the company recently disclosed.  The restatement also reflects adjustments to the company's income statement and balance sheet, now that Enron has decided that the financial activities of Chewco Investments, L.P., Joint Energy Development Investments Limited Partnership (JEDI) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of LJM1 should indeed have been included in the company's consolidated financial statements.  As a result of the restatement, Enron is reducing its 1997 net income by about $96 million, 1998 net income by $113 million, 1999 net income by $250 million and 2000 net income by $132 million.  It is also restating first quarter 2001 results with a $17 million net income increase, second quarter 2001 results with a $5 million increase and third quarter 2001 results with a $17 million net income decrease.  Consolidating Chewco and JEDI also increases Enron's debt by about $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.  "We believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about these matters," said Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay in a statement.

Bailout Seen Unlikely By Jason Leopold  11/08/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  (This story initially ran late Wednesday.) LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Maybe Enron Corp. (ENE) is just too big to fail. Maybe not.  Is the embattled energy trading company important enough to qualify for a federal bailout?  Not likely, according to a number of analysts who believe that there are enough big energy companies in the U.S. to keep markets liquid if Enron goes under.  For that reason, a federal bailout is probably not in the cards, even though Enron controls about 25% of U.S. natural gas and electricity markets, they added.  "A bailout would only occur if needed to maintain liquidity in the energy markets in order to avoid potential for skyrocketing prices and avoid reliability risks," said Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER) analyst Steven Fleishman. "In the end, government is most interested in keeping the lights and the heat on at a reasonable price."  Once a Wall Street darling, Enron's stock has fallen about by 75% in a mere three weeks, and the company is now the subject of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.  Because it's so big, energy companies have watched Enron's troubles closely, and speculated about what they could mean for energy markets overall. A number have said they've started to cut back on their exposure to the company.  Enron's stock has been falling all year, but it plunged several weeks ago after it disclosed a $1.2 billion writedown of shareholder equity. The SEC subsequently launched an investigation into Enron partnerships associated with the writedown.  Enron spokesperson Karen Denne said the company wouldn't speculate on the idea of a bailout.  "First of all I can't speculate, and second of all we're not even going to entertain worst case scenarios," Denne said. "As far as I know no one has approached Washington about a federal bailout."  But one source inside Enron said the company isn't ruling out the possibility of approaching Washington if "things get really bad."  A bailout would require federal legislation.  To qualify, Enron would have to argue that a bailout is an economic necessity, according to Christine Uspenski, an analyst at Schwab Capital Markets (SCH). Quite Different Cup Of Tea From Chrysler   Unlike the situation that led to a $1.2 billion federal bailout of Chrysler Corp. in 1980, hundreds of thousands of jobs aren't now at risk. Enron is nowhere near the size of Chrysler.  "When Chrysler was bailed out there were senators and congressman who were going to have unemployed constituents so they proposed federal legislation to give the company a $1.2 billion loan," Uspenski said. "A bailout would need federal legislation proposed by Texas delegation.It would be hard because Enron is not the size of an employer like Chrysler.The one caveat is bailouts happen to be the fashion of the moment.Enron would have to make a compelling case that this is an economic necessity.They would have to quantify the risk to the energy market and there's such bad karma around the energy market right now."  Robert Christensen, an analyst with FAC Equities in New York, agreed.  "I can't even imagine something like that happening," Christensen said. "It's so far-fetched."  A merger, on the other hand, would funnel billions of dollars into Enron, keep the company afloat and might help the company's stock recover, analysts said.  On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Enron is in talks for a capital infusion and possible acquisition by Dynegy Inc. (DYN). Also, Enron said Thursday it will restate its financial statements from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001, saying its financial and audit reports are unreliable for all those periods. The company fired its treasurer and general counsel.  Andrew Meade, an analyst with Commerzbank in New York, said a bailout would likely never materialize because there are other large traders of energy commodities in the marketplace, such as Duke Energy (DUK), Dynegy, Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Williams Cos. (WMB), that can provide liquidity to the market.  A merger would be a better route for the company, but would pose its own set of problems, Meade added.  "With a merger or an equity infusion, Enron can certainly survive," Meade said. "Enron has a lot of nice attributes, it is a great trading and marketing platform and companies are certainly smart to take a look at it.But merging with or buying Enron is not an easy thing to do because of troublesome issues like a federal investigation and a range of assets that would be pretty tough to sell."  Enron's best assets "get up and go home everyday," Meade said, referring to energy traders at the company. If Enron were to get into a friendly merger or buyout, he added, the company should lock in its top 50 or 100 traders with non-compete clauses. It would be much easier for Dynegy or other Houston energy companies to simply hire Enron employees rather than buy the company.  Other analysts also pointed to risks in a merger with Enron.  "A merger is certainly an option, but it gives you pause if it asks you to be the white knight," Uspenski said. A proposed merger could turn out to be a "minefield and there would certainly be a pretty sizable exposure.It would definitely make shareholders nervous."  Gerald Keenan, a partner in PWC Consulting in Chicago, was skeptical about the proposed reports of a merger between Dynegy and Enron.  "Dynegy is not that big a company," Keenan said. "It has a market cap of about $14 billion.What Enron needs is someone to carry it.How is an entity like Dynegy going to carry Enron?Enron has a small market cap but a huge balance sheet."  Keenan also said Enron wouldn't be likely to secure a federal bailout.  "The only caveat would be if the bailout would have some kind of significant effect on energy commodity markets," Keenan said. "Other than that, it's unlikely the federal government will bail Enron out."  -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron Bonds Give Back Gains as Firm Restates Profit (Update3) 2001-11-08 16:40 (New York)  Enron Bonds Give Back Gains as Firm Restates Profit (Update3)       (Updates bond and stock prices.)       New York, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds pared earlier gains as the biggest energy trader said it restated earnings for more than four years, increasing concern that Dynegy Inc. won't buy out the company.       Enron's 7.88 percent coupon notes due in 2003 traded at 77 cents on the dollar to yield 27 percent, down from a bid of 82 cents this morning, traders said. The debt, which was trading near 100 last month, was bid at 77 cents yesterday. Enron shares, down 75 percent in the last month, fell 64 cents to $8.41 today.       Dynegy said today it's in talks to acquire Enron in what people familiar with the situation said would likely be a stock transaction worth $8 billion. An acquisition would bolster Enron's credit rating, which was recently lowered, traders said.       "Enron bonds justifiably rallied on the good news of Dynegy. They naturally settled back down as the market assesses the significance of the restatement," said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst at CreditSights Inc. "The whole problem goes away and sighs of relief all around if they come to terms with Dynegy."       Enron's 6.4 percent notes due in 2006 were bid at around 70 cents, down from this morning when the debt traded at 84 cents. Yesterday, the notes were priced between 72 cents and 74 cents.       The difference between bid and ask prices for Enron debt widened to about 4 cents to 5 cents -- "monster" spreads, Reynolds said -- from 2 cents this morning, indicating few investors are willing to buy or sell the bonds without more news.       While Moody's Investors Service rates Enron's credit as "Baa2", one rung higher than its "Baa3" grade for Dynegy, other ratings companies including Standard & Poor's and Fitch Inc. have assigned Dynegy a higher rating. Also, Enron's ratings have been cut in recent weeks and face further reduction, while Dynegy's credit outlook is stable.       Enron bonds and shares have tumbled in recent weeks on concern about partnerships run by the company's former chief financial officer and concerns the company's trading business will be hurt by the credit downgrades. Enron and Dynegy are both based in Houston.       Enron has $15.8 billion of bonds outstanding, more than double the $6.8 billion market value of its stock, according to Bloomberg data.    Apache to Cut 2002 Drilling Budget 70% on Gas Prices (Update1) 2001-11-08 16:34 (New York)  Apache to Cut 2002 Drilling Budget 70% on Gas Prices (Update1)       (Updates with closing share price in fifth paragraph and closing Nymex gas price in last paragraph.)       Houston, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Apache Corp., an oil and natural-gas producer, plans to cut spending on drilling next year by 70 percent, blaming wide swings in gas prices caused by traders such as Enron Corp. and Dynegy Inc.       The company will trim spending to $300 million from $1 billion this year, Chief Executive Officer Raymond Plank said in an interview. Gas on the New York Mercantile Exchange reached $10.10 per million British thermal units in late December and touched $1.76 per million British thermal units in September.       The market for gas derivatives is 15 times the cash market for delivery to customers, and broad price changes make it difficult for oil and gas companies to set budgets, Plank said.       "You've got a 150-pound tail wagging a 10-pound dog," Plank said. "You can't predict what your cash flow may be.Therefore, your budgeting is difficult."       Shares of Apache were unchanged at $50.73. They have fallen 28 percent this year. Apache, Dynegy and Enron, the biggest energy trader, are based in Houston.       "We can always go back and take another look at (spending) later," Apache spokesman Tony Lentini said. "We look at our (budget) regularly, and we're known for moving pretty quickly."       Enron, whose plunging stock price forced it to begin merger talks with rival Dynegy, today restated earnings for more than four years because of losses from partnerships under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.       Fearing an Enron collapse might cripple the gas-derivatives market, Apache said yesterday it traded out of most of its gas hedges, making $70 million so far.       "Apache is trying to conserve cash and retain the maximum amount of flexibility," said Irene Haas, an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris Inc. "Apache has been traditionally very nimble in responding to these cycles.There's something to be said for being cautious and conservative when the visibility is bad."       Haas rates Apache "accumulate" and doesn't own its shares.       Nymex gas has averaged $2.7 per million British thermal units so far this quarter, down almost half from the same time a year earlier. It rose 9 cents to $2.96 per million British thermal units today.    Enron Fires Treasurer, Alleges Improper Investment (Update2) 2001-11-08 16:31 (New York)  Enron Fires Treasurer, Alleges Improper Investment (Update2)       (Updates with closing share prices in ninth paragraph and information on board approval starting in 17th paragraph.)       Houston, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which today reduced its earnings for the last four years by $552 million because of accounting errors involving affiliates, also said it fired its treasurer and a corporate attorney for making improper investments in one of the affiliates.       Enron fired Treasurer Ben Glisan and Kristina Mordaunt, the general counsel of an unspecified Enron division. The two invested in an affiliate created by Enron to buy and sell the company's assets, the Houston-based company said in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.       The transactions also involved two former Enron employees and former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who was replaced two weeks ago, the filing said. The former employees were Kathy Lynn, vice president of an unnamed Enron division, and Anne Yaeger, identified by Enron as a non-officer employee.       Lea Fastow, Andrew Fastow's wife, referred all questions to her husband's attorney, who couldn't immediately be reached for comment. Glisan wouldn't comment. Attempts to reach Mordaunt weren't successful.                          $30 Million Profit       Fastow made more than $30 million by managing and investing in two private limited partnerships called LJM Cayman LP, known as LJM1, and LJM2 Co-Investment LP. Enron said on Oct. 24 that Fastow had been replaced as CFO and put on leave. The filing said he is no longer with the company.       Enron said it believes Lynn and Yaeger remain associated with LJM2.       The SEC began a formal investigation into some of Enron's partnerships last month, causing the stock price to plummet from already low levels. Shares of Enron had fallen 89 percent this year, as of the close of trading yesterday.       Enron, short on cash, began merger talks with Dynegy Inc. Yesterday, it failed to reach an agreement with Dynegy to sell itself for about $8 billion in stock. ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 27 percent of Dynegy, is also involved in the talks. Dynegy is concerned credit rating companies may downgrade Enron's debt, people familiar with the situation said.       Enron shares fell 64 cents, or 7.1 percent, $8.41. Shares of Dynegy, which is also based in Houston, rose $3.50, or 11 percent, to $36.50. ChevronTexaco rose 31 cents to $87.59.                              Restatement       Enron restated its earnings for the past four years and the first three quarters of 2001 to incorporate the first LJM partnership, as well as Chewco Investments LP and Joint Energy Development Investments LP, known as JEDI.       Enron calls them special purpose entities, or SPEs. They are vehicles for getting access to capital or hedging risk that can be moved off the books under some circumstances. Enron established more than 30 SPEs.       The company reported that Enron and "Enron-related entities" participated in 24 "business relationships" in which LJM1 or LJM2 participated. They included the sale of asset such as unused fiber optic cable, the purchase of debt or equity interests in Enron affiliates, and the sale by LJM2 of a call and a put option on some assets.      In addition to Chewco and JEDI, a wholly owned subsidiary of LMJ1 that "engaged in derivative transactions with Enron to permit Enron to hedge market risks of an equity investment in Rhythms NetConnections, Inc.," which provides high-speed networking to businesses.       Enron said in the SEC filing that those hedging transactions should have been consolidated into its 1999 and 2000 results because the LJM1 subsidiary was inadequately capitalized. Enron did not specify why transactions by Chewco and JEDI should have been included on its balance sheet.       Enron said it believes that Michael J. Kopper, a former company employee, managed a Chewco general partner and invested in it. The company said it also believes that Kopper was the controlling partner of a limited partnership that (through another limited partnership) in March 2000 purchased interests in affiliated subsidiaries of LJM1."       The company said that it believes the limited partners in that deal also included Glisan, Mordaunt, Lynn and Yaeger.An "entity associated with" Fastow was also a limited partner, Enron said.Enron said that its board approved Fastow's initial transaction with LJM1 and put controls in place that required the review and approval of each transaction by the office of the chairman, the chief accounting officer and the chief risk officer.Lay and Skilling were for many years the only members of the office of the chairman.After Skilling's resignation in August, Enron promoted Greg Whalley to president and chief operating officer and Mark Frevert to vice chairman.Both became members of the office of the chairman.Lay, as chairman, also had the authority to require Fastow to resign from the partnerships at any time.The board also directed that its Audit and Compliance Committee conduct annual reviews of transactions between Enron and LJM1 and LJM2 completed during the previous year, the filing said.Dynegy Rises on Optimism It May Get Enron for Bargain (Update2) 2001-11-08 16:28 (New York)  Dynegy Rises on Optimism It May Get Enron for Bargain (Update2)       (Updates with closing share prices.)       Houston, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. shares rose 11 percent on speculation that the company may be able to buy Enron Corp., the biggest energy trader, at a bargain price.Dynegy said today it's in talks to buy Enron.Dynegy, a rival Houston-based energy trader, is considering an acquisition of Enron for stock valued at almost $8 billion, people familiar with the situation said.With 850 million shares outstanding, Enron has a market value of about $7.7 billion.Enron was forced to consider a sale after its stock plunged this year and its credit ratings were cut amid a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into partnerships run by a former executive.Enron shares yesterday touched $7 a share, their lowest level in more than a decade.A year ago, the stock traded at more than $80 a share."If Dynegy can get Enron for $10 or $11 a share, it's a heck of a good deal," said Sanders Morris Harris analyst John Olson, who owns Enron shares."That's why the shares are up."      Dynegy rose $3.50 a share to $36.50.Enron fell 64 cents, or 7.1 percent, to $8.41.Enron failed yesterday to reach an agreement with Dynegy, which is concerned that credit-rating agencies may reduce Enron's debt to junk status, people familiar with the situation said.Enron today restated earnings for more than four years to include losses from investment partnerships."The lack of (Enron) investor confidence at this point makes it likely that Dynegy could buy Enron and pay little or no premium," said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade.Dynegy "is unlikely to pay significantly more than Enron's current share price if it does make a bid," he said.An acquisition of Enron would make Dynegy the biggest energy trader, eliminating its largest rival, analysts said.Dynegy also would get the leading energy manager for commercial and small- industrial customers, and an Internet energy-trading operation many times larger than its own, analysts said."People are betting for or against a deal with Enron," said Meade, who rates Enron shares "accumulate" and doesn't own them.NewPower 3rd-Qtr Loss Narrows After Adding Customers (Update4) 2001-11-08 16:08 (New York)  NewPower 3rd-Qtr Loss Narrows After Adding Customers (Update4)       (Updates with closing share price in sixth paragraph. Updates Enron's share decline in fifth paragraph.)       Purchase, New York, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- NewPower Holdings Inc., a venture formed by Enron Corp. to compete with traditional gas and electric utilities, said its third-quarter loss narrowed after cutting costs and adding customers.The loss was $67.1 million, or $1.15 a share, compared with a loss of $69.9 million, or $2.96, a year earlier.Revenue tripled to $54.7 million from $18.2 million, the company said.NewPower was forecast to have a loss of $1.16 a share, the average estimate of three analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.NewPower added 80,000 customers in the third quarter and expects to have 840,000 to 860,000 customers by the end of the year.The company, based in Purchase, New York, reduced sales, general and administrative costs by 41 percent, primarily by cutting systems-development and professional expenses.The company is eliminating 40 jobs, or 22 percent of its workforce, to cut costs, Chief Financial Officer William Jacobs said on a conference call.NewPower expects costs of $16 million in the fourth quarter for severance and to end a business alliance with AOL Time Warner Inc., spokeswoman Gael Doar said.Enron, the largest energy trader, owns about 44 percent of NewPower.Houston-based Enron, whose shares have fallen 75 percent since Oct. 16 amid concern over affiliated partnerships run by its former chief financial officer, said it had $544 million in losses on investments including NewPower in the third quarter.Shares of NewPower rose 42 cents to $1.23.The company first sold shares to the public in October 2000 for $21 a share.The offering increased the number of shares outstanding to about 58 million from 23 million.Fourth Quarter       Excluding costs for severance and to end the AOL agreement, NewPower expects a fourth-quarter loss of $41 million to $46 million, or 65 cents to 73 cents a share, and a full-year loss of $210 million to $215 million, or $3.55 to $3.63.The company was expected to lose 74 cents in the fourth quarter, according to First Call's average of three analysts' estimates.The full-year's loss was expected to be $3.71, the average of four analysts' estimates.In 2002, NewPower expects to have a loss of $100 million to $125 million, or $1.59 to $1.99 a share.The average estimate of four analysts polled by First Call was $2.26.NewPower expects to be profitable in 2003 with 1.5 million customers.The company is focusing more on small businesses.It now has 25,000 small-business customers and expects to have more than 35,000 by the end of the year.International Business Machines Corp. owns 1.5 million shares of NewPower, less than 5 percent of the company.Enron Restates Years of Profits, in Talks With Dynegy (Update4) 2001-11-08 15:41 (New York)  Enron Restates Years of Profits, in Talks With Dynegy (Update4)       (Adds Dynegy share price in sixth paragraph.)       Houston, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which began merger talks with Dynegy Inc. after its stock plunged, restated earnings for more than four years to include losses from investment partnerships arranged by senior executives.The largest energy trader failed yesterday to reach an agreement with Dynegy to sell itself for about $8 billion in stock.Dynegy is concerned credit rating companies may downgrade Enron's debt, people familiar with the situation said.A reduction to junk status would precipitate a cash crisis by requiring Enron to repay early $3.3 billion of bonds."Restating earnings for the past five years is suggestive of fraud, which in itself is justification for a downgrade," said Donald Coxe, who manages 78,000 Enron shares as part of the Harris Insight Equity Fund."I'd be surprised if they're not downgraded."       The decision by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay to reduce earnings by $586 million since 1997 is part of Enron's efforts to regain confidence among investors stung by the 89 percent plunge in the stock this year and a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into how the company accounted for partnerships it sponsored.Enron fired Treasurer Ben Glisan and Kristina Mourdant, a lawyer for an Enron division.The company "now believes" Glisan, Mourdant and two other employees no longer working for Enron bought interests in subsidiaries of a partnership run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.Dynegy's shares rose as much as 14 percent on speculation that it may decide not to buy cash-strapped Enron, or, if it did, wouldn't pay much of a premium."People are betting for or against a deal with Enron," said Andre Meade, an analyst with Commerzbank AG who rates Enron "accumulate."Dynegy "is unlikely to pay significantly more than Enron's current share price if it does make a bid," he said.Shares Decline       Enron shares declined 40 cents to $8.65 after the company determined it violated generally accepted accounting rules when it failed to consolidate results for three so-called special purpose entities, vehicles for getting access to capital or hedging risk that can be moved off the books under some circumstances.Enron ousted Fastow last month after revealing an accounting error for transactions with a group of the partnerships resulted in a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in the third quarter.Arthur Andersen LLP was Enron's independent auditor.The company today reduced 1997 net income by $96 million, 1998 earnings by $113 million, 1999 results by $250 million, and 2000 earnings by $132 million.In 2001, the changes resulted in an increase to net income of $17 million in the first quarter and $5 million in the second quarter, and a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter.Enron bonds pared gains after the earnings were restated, as the threat of a credit downgrade dimmed a rally sparked by the Dynegy talks.Enron's debt doubled in the past four years to $13 billion at the end of the third quarter.Both Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service are considering lowering their ratings, which are two levels above junk."Enron is running out of time and that's what's pushing them to the bargaining table," said Zach Wagner, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co., who cut his recommendation on Enron to "reduce" from "accumulate" on Oct. 23.Securities regulators are investigating Enron's web of more than 30 partnerships, including two in which Fastow served as general partner: LJM Cayman LP, known as LJM1, and LJM2 Co- Investment LP, known as LJM2.Fastow received more than $30 million from LJM investments and management fees, Enron said.Labyrinth       The company reported that Enron and "Enron-related entities" participated in 24 "business relationships" in which LJM1 or LJM2 participated.They included the sale of assets, such as unused fiber optic cable, the purchase of debt or equity interests in Enron affiliates, and the sale by LJM2 of a call and a put option on assets.The partnerships involved in the restatement are Chewco Investments LP; Joint Energy Development Investments, known as JEDI; and a wholly owned subsidiary of LJM1 that "engaged in derivative transactions with Enron to permit Enron to hedge market risks of an equity investment in Rhythms NetConnections Inc.," which provides high-speed networking to businesses.Some companies that trade natural gas, electricity and other commodities with Enron may pull back if Enron's finances deteriorate to the point that it loses its investment-grade credit rating, investors say.Atlanta-based Mirant Corp., a top U.S. energy trader, has moved most of its trades away from Enron to other exchanges, such as Intercontinenal Exchange, a venture it formed in March 2000 with other partners including BP Plc and Goldman, Sachs & Co., Mirant spokesman James Peters said."We are still trading with them, but on a very limited basis," said Peters."Dynegy has to act fast," said Roger Hamilton, a money manager with John Hancock Advisers Inc., which sold its Enron shares in recent weeks."If Enron can't get financing and its bonds go to junk, they lose counterparties and their marvelous business vanishes."       Dynegy would gain a wholesale energy business, the leading energy manager for commercial and small-industrial customers, and an Internet energy trading operation many times larger than its own, said UBS Warburg LLC analyst James Yanello."If history is any guide, Dynegy is stingy when it comes to acquisitions, so I don't expect them to do anything stupid" such as overpaying for Enron, said Yanello."A deal could provide Dynegy with tremendous opportunity."He rates Dynegy "strong buy" and doesn't own shares of either company.ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns about 27 percent of Dynegy, is considering adding $1.5 billion to the transaction to help Enron.It would provide another $1 billion when the purchase is closed, the New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported.Breakup Fee       The companies agreed on a breakup fee providing Dynegy with about $400 million if Enron accepts a higher offer, people familiar with the talks said.Dynegy's shares rose as much as $4.30, or 13 percent, to $37.30.The stock had dropped $3 yesterday when news of the Enron talks was first reported.Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer and ChevronTexaco spokesman Fred Gorell declined to comment.Enron plans to meet with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and other lenders tomorrow to discuss the merger plans and a possible increase in the amount the company pays for existing credit lines, according to bankers familiar with the matter.The company has invited more than 300 creditors to its offices in Houston to listen to presentations by Enron's financial team, led by its new chief financial officer, Jeffrey McMahon, the bankers said.Dynegy began in 1985 as Natural Gas Clearinghouse, a gas- trading company.In 1998, the company took the name Dynegy -- a combination of the words dynamic and energy -- to reflect its expansion beyond natural gas.Chuck Watson, the company's president from 1985, became chairman and chief executive in 1989.Watson is an investor with Enron CEO Lay in the Houston Texans, who begin playing in the National Football League next year, and is a board member at Baker Hughes Inc.As of an April filing with the SEC, Watson owned 12.3 million Dynegy shares, or about 5.1 percent of the common stock.DJ FABER REPORT: More On Enron/Dynegy >ENE 2001-11-08 16:00 (New York)      (The following is a portion of a report aired at 3 p.m. Thursday by CNBC reporter David Faber).Enron and Dynegy are still talking about a deal that would result in Enron's purchase by Dynegy.And they would like to either announce a transaction or the lack of one, in the near term.It's still unclear at what price Enron would be purchased, or if the deal will end up as a large investment.People close to the talks do not expect a large premium.A key challenge at present for Dynegy is whether it can conduct enough due diligence of an incredibly complex financial structure to feel comfortable with a takeover.That point was made clear today given Enron just released restated financial results for the last four years of operations.Its peak earnings in 2000 had been $1.12 a share.Now those earnings have been restated to 97 cents.The key to Enron's restatement is the treatment of three off balance sheet partnerships whose debt is guaranteed by Enron.Given that guarantee, Enron's auditors have now concluded the partnerships should have been included on Enron's books.The debt from the partnership has been included in recent quarters, but not for years previous.And if it had been, Enron might not have been able to employ as much leverage in running its business and supercharge the returns on some of its trades.While Dynegy understands Enron's trading business as well as any company could, it still would seem to need time to review its trading book.With the restatement, Enron's return on capital and return on equity is in the mid-single digits.That's well below the ROEs of banks and brokers which Enron most closely resembles in its trading activities.Other issues are also sure to be explored.For example, why did Enron have to extend deposits to counter parties during the June 2001 quarter if business was so good, as would appear to have been the case given the company's strong earnings?And what about Enron's use of derivatives for these relatively new type trades?All these are questions that Dynegy may not have time to answer and so instead may be seeking an expansive material adverse change clause in any merger agreement which will give it wide latitude to exit a deal should it discover things it doesn't like in the future.Dynegy, Enron negotiating merger Enron fires two officers; financial results to be restated  CBSMarketWatch.com Lisa Sanders NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- Enron's troubles deepened Thursday as the energy merchant confirmed it's in merger talks with Dynegy and announced, in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, that it fired two officers and is restating financial results for four years and two quarters.Both Dynegy and Enron confirmed Thursday that they're in negotiations following a published report that an $8 billion deal was close to being finalized.The New York Times reported that Dynegy's board approved a stock offer worth $10 a share for Enron.While confirming the talks, the companies released no further details.Dynegy had no additional comment.An Enron spokeswoman stonewalled reporters Thursday by saying the company was requiring all questions to be submitted in writing.Enron did not respond to the questions.Shares of Enron (ENE ) initially rallied but closed at $8.41, down 64 cents, or 7.1 percent, while Dynegy (DYN ) tacked on $3.50 to close at $36.50.ChevronTexaco (CVX ), which owns 27 percent of Dynegy, will contribute $2.5 billion to the deal, the Times reported.ChevronTexaco, which added 31 cents to close at $87.59, declined to comment.Also Thursday, Enron in an SEC filing said it has fired its treasurer, Ben Glisan, and the general counsel of an Enron division, Kristina Mordaunt.Earlier in the month, Enron fired chief financial officer Andy Fastow for his role in limited partnerships that are now under investigation by the SEC.Enron restated its financial results for the years 1997 through 2000 and the first two quarters of 2001.Enron has lost most of its market value over the past month after the SEC launched a probe of some transactions by company executives.Enron would bring huge debt A merger of Dynegy and Enron would require the smaller company to take on the $12.8 billion in debt that's now on Enron's books.The acquisition would likely lead to the sale of additional Enron assets to pay down the debts, the Times reported.Boards of both companies were meeting in Houston on Wednesday night, according to the paper."If you look at the balance sheets of Dynegy and Enron, (a merger) would be a tough deal," Jeff Dietert of Simmons & Co.He noted that Dynegy (DYN ) has $3 billion worth of debt and a market capitalization of $11.7 billion."Enron's debt load is likely to be too significant for Dynegy to step up and swallow," Dietert said.For Dynegy to make the deal, it would have to issue equity, he added.It would make more sense for Dynegy to consider buying some Enron assets, Dietert said.That would also help Enron clean up its balance sheet.Chris Ellinghaus of Williams Capital Group said that ChevronTexaco's involvement would make a Dynegy-Enron combination more realistic."We would view this transaction favorably assuming Dynegy intends to dispose of Enron's myriad of non-core businesses," Ellinghaus said.Dynegy and Enron together would dwarf other natural gas and power marketers in the U.S.  Ellinghaus said the possibility that Dynegy would buy Enron is "staggering." "However, the failure of Enron to procure an outside equity infusion has apparently severely limited Enron's options," he said."We do not believe the potential demise of Enron invalidates the merchant energy model or suggest deeper problems within the wholesale energy markets."Gregory Phelps, vice president and portfolio manager of John Hancock's Patriot Group of closed-end income funds, said Enron, even in its current state, retains some intrinsic value."Enron still has an incredible number of contractual trading arrangements out there that can't be allowed to crumble and fall," he added."I think that a firm like Dynegy with a firm like ChevronTexaco as partner adds the credibility that Enron needs."Dynegy gets to buy "assets on the cheap" that it can tie into its own growth-oriented operations, he said.Phelps has never owned Enron stock in his funds because he says it's too volatile and the company makes it too hard to understand how it generates revenue.Bush ties  Enron's Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay stepped back into the CEO spot following the abrupt departure of Jeffrey K. Skilling, who left after just six months on the job for "personal reasons."Skilling was called to testify in Washington, D.C., this week, though the SEC would not confirm whether it was before their agency.In a conference call with investors Wednesday, El Paso Energy Chairman and Chief Executive William Wise said his company would consider buying some of Enron's assets, though he declined to specify which ones."We are an asset-oriented company, and we would look at their assets," Wise said."Rather than list any of them for you, you can make your own judgments."  Wednesday, A.G. Edwards cut its rating on Enron to "sell" from "hold," saying the only reason to own the stock now would be to bet that some company would bid for Enron or a large part of its wholesale trading operations.Azurix divestiture  Also Thursday, Azurix Corp., an affiliate of Enron, said it sold its Azurix North America and Azurix Industrial to American Water Works for $141.5 million in cash and the assumption of $6.1 million of debt.Azurix is a water and wastewater company.In the third quarter, Enron took a $1 billion charge, which included $287 million for asset impairments at Azurix.Lisa Sanders is a Dallas-based reporter for CBS.MarketWatch.com.",0,0,0
408,"Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets   Wow!What a year 2001 has been for the supporters of energy competition.For every good bit of news (Pat Wood, one of our heroes at CAEM, being selected to head the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the continuing progress that the Canadians ? yes, the Canadians ? have made towards energy competition), we have had to bear one disaster and misstep after another throughout the year.Let?s see, in December 2000, who could have predicted?.1.  The tragic events of September 11th.2.  The California implosion.3.  Pennsylvania marketer retrenchment.4.  Price volatility and high prices (but it could have been worse if Mother Nature did not help out).5.  Bush Energy Plan ignores meaningful restructuring.6.  Enron collapse.7.  FERC Blinks on Super RTO.8.  Texas missteps in pilots for opening the market.9.  No leadership emerged to meet the crisis in restructuring.2001 was one heck of a year ?but thankfully, probably the nadir of the movement towards energy competition in North America.As CAEM looks into our crystal ball (natural gas fired, of course) for the coming year, we see a better year.Below are some of the predictions and responses from the CAEM staff about what we expect to occur.The responses below are primarily concerned with electricity, but to a lesser extent, may be applied to natural gas as well.As always, do not bet the house on what we have to say.We are just a little think tank, kind of like the little engine that could.And we can.And we do.Happy New Year!The CAEM Staff  P.S. If you would like to add a prediction or two, please send an e-mail with your name and contact information to Hope Duncan at hduncan@caem.org  We will post them to our web site ?www.caem.org  Please identify which question below is being addressed by your prediction.CAEM PREDICTIONS IN 2002  What does Enron?s collapse mean?1. Markets work.Markets quickly punish mistakes.Little slack is given for past accomplishments.Markets are ruthlessly impersonal.2. No likely short term impact on consumers, other traders will fill the space left by Enron.Amazing that a company as large as Enron can fail and hardly cause a ripple in markets.Testimonial to benefits of markets.3. May have significant impact on public policy advocacy.Not obvious who picks up the slack.Enron could be counted on to be there, or so it appeared.No more free riders, we will all have to dig deeper and work harder.Consumers may be mid to long term losers if movement toward competition collapses, which it might do if states stretch out the transition period to competition.4. Enron?s collapse was not caused by deregulation.Viewed thoughtfully, it should not have any effect on deregulation movement.Does not stand for proposition that deregulation is not the right policy.5. Look for more regulation and oversight of energy transactions, accounting and business practices.A strange legacy for Enron, but a reality.6. As a practical matter, it is another setback for restructuring.But not as bad as portrayed by media ?Enron was the 600 pound gorilla that angered friends of competition almost as much as foes, thus making them less willing to step forward.Will feed growing skepticism many have about restructuring.7. Enron?s global reach into wholesale and retail markets meant that its policy positions were sometimes blurred (pro-wholesale? pro energy services?) Other corporations will now replace Enron in public policy debates; these corporations may have a clearer focus.8. Still, we have lost a champion.CAEM will miss their culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations, which led to the unbundling of the classic power contract (or paper or water, etc) into its constituent parts and offered customers choices on each one.Enron also pioneered risk assessment and control systems.What will be the fate of the movement towards retail energy competition in 2002?1. CAEM believes that the movement toward retail energy competition will continue ?albeit much more slowly.2. Texas is the best model to date and will set the standard for other states in 2002 and beyond.Why?The best incentives are in place for large numbers of commercial and industrial consumers to competitively shop for supply.The Texas model ties changes to the wholesale market to the retail market.(Texas, through ERCOT, is unique in this respect.)  No price caps.Market power of incumbents is limited.Enlightened leadership at the Texas PUC from 1995 to 2000 (our friend, Pat Wood again ? but we believe Commissioner Perlman is a star as well) and in the Governor?s office.3. Other states that have already made a decision to move forward will seek to correct deficiencies ?Pennsylvania, New Jersey, etc.?or avoid past mistakes altogether ?Virginia.However, there will be very limited movement in these states.4. California will continue to suffer from a lack of imagination and poor leadership from the Governor on down.There is a good chance that CAEM will again be awarding Governor Davis the ?Red China?award in 2002.5. Californians will be reminded again that rolling blackouts are a form of ?involuntary?conservation.6. Very limited movement, perhaps some experimentation or demonstration projects, in those states that have done nothing to date.7. Increasing effort to approximate market-like conditions, but under a regulated, cost-based system, with predictable results.8. Actually, beyond Texas, the best hope for significant movement towards competition is in North America is in Canada, particularly Alberta and Ontario.Given the increasing interconnection between the U.S. and Canada, this will slowly work its way into the United States.9. It will be another wild ride for energy marketers in 2002.More power to them.What will happen on the wholesale side of the picture in 2002?1. CAEM believes that there will be significant strides made to increase liquidity and competition in the wholesale market for electricity.2. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will be successful, to a degree, in implementing Super RTOs (regional transmission organizations).3. CAEM supports the Bush Administration?s proposal to give eminent domain to FERC for the siting of new transmission lines.However, this proposal faces tough sledding in Congress.CAEM believes it will pass in some form ?probably very watered down ?out of necessity, but not out of love.Many in Congress still believe we can conserve our way to prosperity.4. The Federal government and the states will make progress ?probably embodied in a political deal ?on greater cooperation.This will be regional in focus.Both sides will give significant concessions to realize this.5. New players will enter market as it grows, including the oil companies and more foreign-based companies.Wildcards/ Predictions in 2002   1. The Bush Administration will come under increasing pressure to show leadership in the area of energy restructuring.To date, the Bush Administration has stayed on the sidelines ?except making the right noises here and there ?of making energy markets more competitive.This will need to change, beginning with more funds and staff devoted to helping the states on the retail side and supporting FERC in their efforts on the wholesale side.2. The new Electricity Advisory Board appointed by DOE Secretary Abraham will be seen for what it is ?a sop to campaign supporters.Given its current make up, we expect very little to come of it.Couldn?t they find more energy marketers, technology companies ?anyone that is a bit more pro-competition?3. The Department of Energy will continue to have little impact -- if any -- on energy restructuring issues and will remain largely irrelevant to the competitive energy market.4. The Department of Energy will continue to fight for tougher appliance efficiency standards, while totally ignoring the far lower efficiency of electricity production, thus marginalizing its impact on energy efficiency.5. ?Comprehensive?energy legislation will probably pass in 2002.The question is whether it will be truly comprehensive and have a separate and new section devoted to electric restructuring.(The Senate version does and the House is working on one.)  Our guess is that it will to some degree.Our hope is that the energy legislation moves beyond pork politics and members of Congress will resist the temptation to earmark projects.Fat chance of that happening, but it is Christmas time.6. As part of the political deal, there is the opportunity for a ?New Federalism?policy to be realized for the energy sector.If the Bush Administration truly wants to move competition forward, and yet have the states go along with it, a new block grant with conditions for moving towards competition could be formed to serve as a carrot.The Feds do it with highway funds and education ?why not energy?The states, familiar with federal block grants for highways and education will try to cut as many of the ?strings?attached to the grants as possible.7. A major blackout in 2002.The laws of probability suggest that we are due for a reminder about how old our infrastructure is and how the lack of attention to how these markets are performing will have consequences.The U.S. has dodged many bullets in the past ?but probably not this year.(BPA will likely not cause the blackout this time, as it did twice in 1996, unless the Pacific Northwest gets a lot of snow this winter or a lot of rain this spring.) ( The blackout will likely not happen in Manhattan, since peak demand was reduced by ~ 300 mW on September 11th.)  We recognize this a risky prediction ?predicting what terrorists or what the weather may do always is ?but it is only a matter of time.8. The environmental movement will begin to wake up to the fact that its interests are not the same as those of consumer activists.Competition will lead to more efficient production ?and thus less pollution ?to the extent it is allowed to occur.Seeking lower prices at all costs, including the cost to the environment, consumer advocates want to preserve the monopoly model, which has led and will continue to lead to the maximum use of old, and polluting technologies and infrastructure.9. For that matter, the anti-coalition (kind of like anti-matter, not much there) of critics should splinter even further vs. organized labor (high costs, high prices).10. New grid-enhancing technologies, e.g., superconductivity, and distributed energy technologies, e.g., fuel cells, should make significant market gains in 2002, assuming Congress, DOE and EPA take no further actions to prevent this from happening.There is a lot of pessimism in the distributed energy community right now ?and who wouldn?t be a bit pessimistic, given the exit of Honeywell from the market, the constant technical setbacks, the wariness of the utilities, the bickering and backbiting, etc.But folks, this is the future ?and the future starts now.11. EPA will continue to protect the ?right?of existing generators to pollute at rates an order of magnitude greater than the pollution rates required of new generators, ?in the interest of fairness?.12. EPA will continue to discourage incremental improvements in the efficiency and emissions of existing power plants by insisting that the incremental improvements subject the plants to new source review.13. EPA will proceed with issuance of a proposed guidance document requiring combined heat and power systems and building cooling, heating and power systems to achieve better combined electrical and thermal efficiency than the best available separate electric generation and thermal energy conversion technologies, but will not require that all separate electric generation and thermal energy conversion installations use the best available technology.(No one will question why this efficiency requirement is coming from EPA and not DOE.)   14. The tax code will continue to require owners of on-site generation systems to depreciate the systems over time periods longer than their expected useful lives.",0,0,0

414,"Are you putting words in my mouth Tim.The East is absolutely adamant about having a liquid real-time energy markets  with a "real supply curve" and a "real demand curve" such that hourly  clearing prices reflect the true economic value of the commodity.With  respect to the number of hourly price signals within an RTO that is  necessary, that is subject to much debate.Although I prefer a zonal model  for simplicity reasons, the reality is that congestion is more prevalent in  the East in most of the markets and in order to get a functioning real time  energy market, we may have settle for a limited LMP, in which nodal pricing  is necessary for managing the congestion, but proxy buses are created in  zones (3-5 per RTO) for purposes of real-time energy markets.Our views, I believe, are still very much aligned, however, I need to make  some progress on the creation of real time energy markets.The zonal  markets implemented in NEPOOL and contemplated for ERCOT result in a  mis-priced commodity with no "real" price signal sent to the market.Out of  merit generation is and will continue to be dispatched because the congestion  is managed through energy uplift payments (congestion price signal is not  sent to the market).This results in a very inefficient commodity market  where the consumer gets screwed and market makers can't price the commodity  or transportation on a forward basis.I hope this clarifies any misunderstanding.",0,0,0

417,"Dear Friend,Greetings to you.I wish to accost you with a request that would be of immense benefit to both of us.Being an executor of wills, it is possible that we may be tempted to make fortune out of our client's situations, when we cannot help it, or left with no better option.The issue I am presenting to you is a case of my client who willed a fortune to his next-of-kin.It was most unfortunate that he and his next-of-kin died on the same day the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board.You can confirm this from the website below which was published by BBC WORLD NEWS.WEBSITE.http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm.I am now faced with confusion of who to pass the fortune to.According to the English law, the fortune is supposed to be bequeathed to the government,if nobody comes forward as the next of kin within seven years of the demise of the benefactor of the will.My purpose of contacting you is to seek your acting as the beneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the legacy of $7million, which my deceased client  bequeathed to his next-of-kin.For now, I alone know about his will, as my client had great confidence in me.Everything will be left between you and I.The share would be 25% for you and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the tsunami victims,as this is my primary objective.All I have to do is amend the will or add a codicil to make you the beneficiary to the $7million legacy.Again, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider this amount too big for you to defend.It does not matter, as there are documents to back it up.This is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-kin.As I am not very sure of getting your consent on the issue I prefer not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being disbarred.The English Bar considers it a breach of the oath of the English Bar.I need not emphasize to you that the sensitivity of this issue need not be toyed with by neglecting its confidentiality.I therefore appeal to you not discuss this request with anybody, even if you decline my request.I look forward to hearing from you soon.Yours trulyStephen Ayling.",1,0,0
418,"MR. CHEUNG PUIHANG SENG BANK LTD.DES VOEUX RD.BRANCH,CENTRAL HONG KONG,HONG KONG.Let me start by introducing myself.I am Mr. Cheung Pui director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have an urgent business suggestion for you.I honestly apologize and hope I do not cause you much embarrassment by contacting you through this means for a transaction of this magnitude,but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.Furthermore,due to this issue on my hands now,it became necesary for me to seek your assistance, and it is imperative for me to know your opinionBefore the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Bassem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year.Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him.We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem  did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit.And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank.So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it.What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 5 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem  so that you will be able to receive his funds.WHAT IS TO BE DONE:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful.I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job.After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents.Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning thisissue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incure during the transaction.Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefer you to reach me via my private box, {che_Pui67@yahoo.com.hk} and finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this operation.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind Regards,Mr Cheung Pui.___________________________________________________________________________Mail envoyï¿½ par le service WebMail du Site PHP-Nuke- http://www.forcetacticalarmy.com",1,1,0

(Edelstein lives in the settlement of Neve Daniel).Back in the US the former Israel lobbyist and ex-Clinton Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk took to the WashingtonPost's op-ed page to praise Netanyahu and Barack Obama for ensuring that "there were zero building starts in the WestBank settlements."During the week of June 21 I traveled through the West Bank with Swedish photojournalist Linda Forsell to documentnew settlement construction and the settlers' theft of water from Palestinian towns.Forsell took a series of photos at HarHoma a massive Israeli settlement towering over the Palestinian town of Beit Sarhour.Her photos show ongoingconstruction of hundreds of new settlement units â documents of the settlement freeze sham.0Netanyahu authorized the building of new settlement units just days after heannounced the freeze in November 2009.He attempted to disguise new settlement construction by drawing a falsedistinction between the West Bank and "parts of Jerusalem" like Har Homa that actually lie outside 1967 lines.As Israeligovernment flack Mark Regev remarked in December 2009 "We've made a clear distinction between the West Bank andJerusalem. Jerusalem is our capital and will stay as such."With a few exceptions Obama allowed this scheme to goforward.According to the Washington Post Obama's meeting with Netanyahu this week will have more to do with reassuringJewish Democrats than with halting the wholesale colonization of the West Bank.As the Post's Anne Kornblut reported"The White House meeting will not dwell on some of the most difficult time-sensitive issues including the expiration of amoratorium on Israeli settlement construction in September."This may mean an end to the settlement freeze but it wasonly an illusion after all.",0,0,0

525,"Pis read the following.I've followed this caseTorture on homefront cries out for justiceComments <http://www.suntimes.comews/marin/1734591CST-EDT-caro126.article>August 26 2009BY CAROL MARIN <mailto:cmarin@suntimes.com> Sun-Times ColumnistThe feds can't -- just yet -- deport Michigan restaurateur Ibrahim Parlak to his native Turkey.But they are frighteninglycloser.And the irony screams out.Carol MannOn Monday the same day Eric Holder President Obama's attorney general announced he would appoint a specialcounsel to investigate whether torture was used by the CIA to extract confessions from foreign suspects a U.S. appealscourt at the behest of the U.S. government ruled that it didn't have a problem sending Parlak back to the country wherehe was tortured -- imprisoned for 17 months shocked with electrodes hung by his arms and sexually violated.A Turkish Kurd Parlak was granted political asylum in 1992.It was before our government got cozier with Turkey beforeit re-classified some of the Kurdish separatist movement as "terrorist" and before the attacks of Sept. 11.With 9/11Ibrahim Parlak's horror began anew.Suddenly he looked different to the newly created Department of Homeland Security and to the Justice Department'sImmigration courts.Instead of seeing a hard-working tax-paying Chamber of Commerce member who ran Cafe Gulistana small Middle Eastern restaurant in the resort town of Harbert Mich. tlie feds now saw an international menace.In 2004 the FBI grabbed Parlak and locked him up.If it hadn't been for a volunteer team of lawyers including a Reagan-appointed former U.S. attorney a former FBI anti-terrorism legal adviser and the bipartisan intervention of Michigan's Sen. Carl Levin a liberal Democrat and Rep. FredUpton a conservative Republican Parlak would still be in jail.Thanks to them this 47-year-old father of a 12-year-old girl is temporarily free.But just barely.The newest outrage is the 2-1 decision issued by Cincinnati's 6th Circuit Court of Appeals on the same day Holderlaunched his torture inquiry.B5The majority opinion was issued by two Bush appointees put on the bench after 9/11.Judge Julia Smith Gibbons andJudge Jeffrey Sutton upheld the Justice Department's Immigration courts ruling that Parlak failed to disclose hisrelationship to the now-labeled terrorist organization even though he was never proven to be a member.Let's remember something about our immigration courts.They are not independent.They work for whoever is theattorney general.And the past rulings against Parlak came under two now-controversial Bush appointees John Ashcroftand Alberto Gonzales.The fairness of immigration rulings has been ripped by none other than Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court ofAppeals one of the nation's most brilliant judges.By September of 2005 Posner noted "a staggering 40 percent of the136 petitions" had been reversed due to according to one ruling a willingness to ignore "the most basic of facts."Echoing Posner now is the dissenting judge on the Parlak appeal.Judge Boyce F. Martin a Carter appointee writes withboth clarity and conviction arguing the government's "awesome power was used here to railroad a man out of ourcountry."Like a surgeon Martin dissects the Justice Department's immigration courts and the majority opinion of his owncolleagues and ends by saying "I remain hopeful nevertheless that this case is but a sad remnant of an era of paranoidoverzealous error-riddled and misguided anti-terrorism and immigration enforcement that has now gone by thewayside. It is just a shame that even if my hope proves true it is too late for Ibrahim Parlak."Parlak's legal team will appeal.Meanwhile Holder like Ashcroft and Gonzales before him is the new boss of the immigration courts.As he investigates questions of U.S. torture abroad here's hoping Holder examines the ongoing domestic legal torture ofIbrahim Parlak.",0,0,0

528,"See hus analysis of where we are on EAS but also on the US Japan and Chinese urbanization and trade patterns..Nothing that new but valuable coming from him.The Australian - 19 Jun 10Embracing everyone from the US to India Greg Sheridan Foreign editorGEORGE Yeo Singapore's Foreign Minister is one of the most dazzlingly clever people you could meet in SoutheastAsia.Singapore is a society that notoriously produces hardheads in its strategic outlook.But Yeo combines Singapore'scharacteristic hard-headedness with a depth of historical understanding and context as well as a lively human sympathyfor the diversity of the region that surrounds him which I at any event find almost unique.I remember interviewinghim at the height of the East Asian economic crisis in 1997 and asking whether this crisis shattered the idea of Asia asthe growing centre of the global economy as numerous foolishly triumphalist Western commentators were thensuggesting."No it doesn't"Yeo told me."At the most it might put back the forecasts by five or 10 years."It moved thegraph a little to the right it didn't change the trends.On that Yeo was absolutely right.But it is also Yeo's ability to apply the insights of history to the real problems of Asia today which make him formidable.This week Yeo spent a few days in Australia and I caught up with him for one of those slightly mesmerising historicaltour de force conversations in which he specialises.It is no secret Singapore had the most serious reservations about Kevin Rudd's proposal to establish an Asia-PacificCommunity.The Prime Minister wanted the US India and Russia included in a regional body which could deal withstrategic issues as well as trade and economics.Singapore's hesitation over the Rudd proposal came because it thoughtthat the Association of Southeast Asian Nations of which it is a key member could be sidelined.I asked Yeo whether theregion was now clear on what it wanted its organisations to accomplish."We still need a lot more discussion" he said."The vision is going to change dramatically with the emergence of China and India on the global stage. Theconfiguration is evolving much faster than most of us would have preferred. But that's the reality we've got to workwith. We need a regional architecture which is able to accommodate the stresses. The single most important relationship isbetween the US and China. Increasingly the relationship between India and China is becoming more important. I thinkeventually a triangular relationship will decide the big issues of war and peace in Asia this century - the triangleconsisting of the US China and India."Yeo saw Rudd and Foreign Minister Stephen Smith in Canberra and now describes Canberra and Singapore as being inharmony on the evolution of regional organisations.This is how he saw it having played out: "When Prime Minister Ruddproposed the APC Dick Woolcott (Rudd's envoy) went round the region. He did not visit all countries. He made it quiteplain to some that only the big countries of ASEAN need to be involved. We talked among ourselves and quite soon theconclusion was reached that ASEAN was going to be sidelined. So there was an immediate blowback from the region."To PM Rudd's credit he quickly clarified this that ASEAN is central to his conception of the APC and that that was hisvision from the very beginning.I said 'All of us in the region are very relieved to hear that'."Separately we had (former Japanese) prime minister (Yukio) Hatoyama articulating his view of an East Asian regionapparently centred on China Japan and Korea. It created as you would expect a natural reaction in Southeast Asia. Thatgot us all thinking in the region. How to keep Russia and the US in the region in a way that's comfortable. For a long timewe've been thinking about China more recently about India."Yeo pointed out that earlier regional organisations alsoevolved slowly in particular the East Asia Summit which includes Australia and New Zealand as well as ASEAN ChinaJapan South Korea and India.He said: "It took us a long time to create the EAS structure. Some preferred it to be basedon the ASEAN plus three (China Japan Korea) harking back to (former Malaysian prime minister) Mahathir(Mohamad)'s East Asian caucus. "Others felt that's too limiting.If it's just ASEAN plus three that may be a little lop-sidedbecause of the economic weight of the plus three.So we thought if we have India on one side and Australia and NewZealand to the south there's a certain natural equipoise."Then it took many discussions. The Russians wanted to join the EAS but we felt this should not be rushed. Russia is tooimportant a country. There was some unhappiness from the Russians that we did not accommodate them in the EAS atthat time. (Former US) President (George W.) Bush did not want to join the EAS but he worried that the EAS mightexclude the US from the region. We told our American friends that it could not be purely an Asian thing becauseAustralia and New Zealand were in it. In any case countries like Singapore would never want an EAS to be exclusive. What would threaten us most is if the world developed into blocs."So where do we end up today?"When I met PM Rudd I thanked him for helping to catalyse the thinking of ASEAN. Sonow there are two possibilities either an EAS expanded for Russia and the US or a separate ASEAN plus eight (includingthe US and Russia) configuration. In fact I had a very interesting discussion with Prime Minister Rudd. I think in the endhe's happy to let ASEAN members decide and he doesn't want to interfere in our regional discussion."So you can describe what Yeo outlines as either a win or a loss for Rudd.Whatever evolves nobody is going to call it theAsia-Pacific Community and no one is going to imagine that Rudd was its founder as everyone accepts that Bob Hawkefounded APEC in 1989.On the other hand it does seem as though it's very much more than likely that there will finallybe a regional organisation embracing everyone from the US to India which is able to discuss security.That is prettymuch Rudd's policy aim and as Yeo constructively puts it Rudd has influenced ASEAN thinking.Friends of Rudd candescribe it as the embodiment of his vision and fulfilment of his initiative.His enemies can say the APC came to nothingand was a failure in Australian diplomacy.Certainly Yeo casts it in a constructive light.There is only space to give thesmallest sampling of Yeo's prodigiously rich insights on other issues.On the US he said: "Both Australia and Singapore feel it in our bones that the US will remain a great power for manydecades. It is a vast country always throwing up new ideas always on the boil. It has a sunny disposition. We inSingapore and Australia feel it in our bones that one way or another they will get out of their current difficulties."On China I asked whether its political development was keeping pace with its growth in power financial and military soit could manage that new power in a way that was beneficial to everybody.Yeo stressed that he was sure Beijing'spreoccupations were internal and said: "China is the No 1 trading partner for Japan Korea Taiwan Hong Kong Indiaand already No 2 for New Zealand and for all the countries (in Asia) the graph points in the same direction."(The historical process) is high drama in China.It was historically because of the large rural peasantry that Maoismdeveloped as a different ideology from Bolshevism.China was 20 per cent urban.It's now 40 per cent urban and will goto 80 per cent or 90 per cent.The urbanisation of Europe was languid by comparison but look at Dickens or Victor Hugo.Look at the huge reaction in Europe to urbanisation and industrialisation.In China it's all compressed.If they succeedthey will be the greatest nation on Earth.The Chinese know they have to learn new tricks.The skills which brought themto power won't keep them in power."He recalled that early in China's economic modernisation program it was fascinated by how Singapore as a mostlyChinese nation ran its society in such an orderly and effective manner combining rapid economic growth with socialorder and a respect for tradition. Then that interest seemed to wane. But now Chinese delegations are back again inlarge numbers fascinated particularly with how Singapore manages the politics of being a big and boomingcity. Mainland Chinese are even sitting in on politicians' electoral clinics in Singapore observing how real problems arerecognised integrated into the system and dealt with. I asked Yeo too whether he thought Japan could sustain the stabilising role it has played in Asia these past 60 years. Hereplied: "Their politics now are a mess.Partly because they fit the pieces together so closely reconfiguring the pieces is-difficult.A lot of Japanese politics now is not about fitting the pieces together but pulling them apart."The DP1 came to power determined to pull the pieces apart the Liberal Democratic Party from big business from thebureacracy. Never write Japan off. It takes a long time for them to change but when they do change they do it with afury and intensity that surprises everyone."Japan has gone through profound periods of change in the past - the MeijiRestoration of the 19th century in which it decided to become a modern nation; or the pervasive change after WorldWar II in which it decided to embrace democracy and the role of the key US ally in the region.The fact that it is nowgrappling with change is no reason to think it cannot emerge again with a successful model.Yeo is an old old friend of Australia and in a sense a long-term champion of Australia's involvement in Southeast Asia.He has been a minister in the Singapore government for more than 20 years.He embodies a great deal of institutionalmemory and strategic continuity not just within Singapore but within the broader councils of the region.It's just a pity he doesn't visit us a bit more often.",0,0,0

N (1 :(1 Jr) F*az.-.1--anracsounga.awarnrmacta=ava-_rmuacartatmott--=-0....-rmaamaxatiAmasm...u.cnromar r.nocura--uarni.m.rarcnt.r.trnmar.rarti:4.3resecono....riatvars:I recently had the opportunity to participate in a small dinner with CENTCOM Commander .General David Petraeus and his wife Holly. These sorts of discussions are nearly always off the record -- but the fact thatthey happened is not off limits. Petraeus was not in uniform but rather wore what looked to me to be a brand new perfectly tailored dark suit. I joked tohim that if I Twilt.--srgc that out of two dozen or so times I had seen Petraeus that this was the first time I'd seen him out ofuniform an ice cold shudder of fear would spread quickly through some political circles in DC.In August of 2007 I wroteoiece stating that folks should keep an eye out for the possibility that General Petraeus mightrun for President in 2012. In April 2008 Steven Lee Myers wrote a solid New York Times follow up titled "TheGeneral" referencing my earlier take. Recently legendary newsman Ai:nai4d de 13orchgave resuscitated the topic of an Eisenhoweresque future for thecounterinsurgency guru in his piece "President ?etraeus7"Petraeus was recently named as one of Foreign Policy magazine's tip 100 ttzal thinkers and as U.S. News & WorldReports "Washington Whispers" notes he is going to be speaking in May 2010 at the annual American EnterpriseInstitute dinner receiving the Irving Kristol Award. In January 2010 Public Policy Pollin.q revealed that while Obama held a ten point lead over a potential wild card raceagainst Petraeus the General had some strengths. But the pollsters also noted that many in the American public justdidn't know enough yet about Petraeus to form an opinion:Finally our blog readers voted for David Petraeus as our wild card Republican this month and hisnumbers come out as a mixed bag. He has the largest deficit against Obama trailing 44-34. But at +13his net favorability is better than the President or any of the other Republicans we tested. The problem forhim is that the numbers break down 25/12- 63% of voters in the country don't know enough about him tohave formed an opinion. Who knows if Petraeus would actually have any interest in going into politics butif he did he would be introducing himself to many voters for the first time. President Obama himself according to what some of his aides have reported to me is quite taken with David Petraeusand respects his approach and thinking. Petraeus has also been respectful of the President -- although when pushed at a recent forum about how he might reactto a Presidential decision on Afghanistan that the General might not have liked Petraeus offered a cryptic rather thanclear response. (see above video)At the "First Draft of History" meeting sponsored by the Atlantic Monthly/Atlantic Media Group the Newseum and theAspen Institute; Petraeus when asked if he would support the President no matter what the result of the strategic reviewon Afghanistan responded that he "would continue to give the President the best professional military advice he could."Contrast that with Defense Secretary Robert Gates resoonOinato_the..saest.ipr.j. "We will salute and execute [thePresident's] decisions faithfully and to the best of our ability."But after spending an evening with General Petraeus and watching him closely for a number of years there is no way thatthis intelligent leader -- with whom I have some disagreements but respect -- could be comfortable with the Tea Partytakeover of the Republican political machine.There is always the possibility that a core of reasonable Republicans like Michael Bloomberg James Baker OlympiaSnowe Chuck Hegel Alan Simpson John Whitehead Peter Peterson Rita Hauser and others will try to rekindle classicRepublican sensibilities by fighting to re-hijack their party back in an Eisenhower-like campaign with Petraeus at the lead.Remember that Eisenhower clinched the Republican nomination by promising to be the President who though he knewwar would end the Korean War.Petraeus knows Afghanistan and Iraq -- and though it seems hard to envision today couldbe the kind of leader promising to end those wars if Obama proves unable to do so. But there is another option that intrigues me and seems more realistic than imagining the iconic David Petraeus runningfor President -- and that is his running for Vice President.I think Vice President Joe Biden has done an outstanding job and of all the big guns in the Obama White House Bidenhas done the best job of outperforming expectations.He had given President Obama much needed counsel not alwaystaken regrettably but counsel that Obama needed to show the American public he was getting.Biden has been the keyagent behind the scenes in moving Iraq's elections forward.He has scored a lot of wins -- not reported -- in thenuclear/WMD controls arena.Biden has worked with Gates in stabilizing an awkward and complex relationship withRussia -- and his counterpoints on the Afghanistan surge in my view remain compelling. But Biden is going to have to find a way to hold his spot in 2012 because others are going to be gunning for it. As I look at it now Hillary Clinton who has now said that she will not do more than one term as Secretary of State wouldbe a natural candidate for the Obama VP slot. Her franchise is not completely in the control of the Obama team yet butmoving Hillary closer to the White House (although her private home on Whitehaven Street is actually a couple of hundredfeet closer to the White House than the VP residence at the Naval Observatory) would finalize Obarna's takeover of all thekey political franchises in the Democratic Party -- starting with Daley's machine Deschle's machine Kennedy's machineEdwards' machine and then the Clintons'.But General David Petraeus in his business suit lurks out there.Obama seems to be concerned about looking like he isweak on national security.The Republicans -- at Cheney's constant goading (and now Sarah Palin's) -- seem to want tocontinue to play politics through fear-mongering.Obama could neutralize the possibility that he faces a Republican party challenge by David Petraeus by inviting theGeneral on to the 2012 ticket as a Democrat.Crazy?Perhaps.But inviting potential rivals into his tent is becoming a standard Obama trademark -- much as he did by appointingRepublican Governor of Utah and former G.W. Bush administration Deputy US Trade Representative Jon Huntsman Jr.to serve as US Ambassador to the People's Republic of China. And get this we have just learned that David Petraeus has not voted since 2002 -- not because he doesn't care to vote --but reportedly because he wants to keep his eventual political options and political loyalties open. This is a soldier for whom all options are on the table and who is keeping his powder dry. My hunch is that whether Obama sticks with Vice President Biden or pivots to someone else Petraeus will be on the shortlist of those considered.-- Steve Clemons publishes the popular political blog The Washington Note.",0,0,0

The boss was pretty disappointed" the adviser told the magazine.McChrystal a famous workaholic said to sleep just four hours a day was brought into Afghanistan a year ago after his predecessorwas pushed out.The article portrays his teams as disapproving of the Obama administration with the exception of Secretary of State Hillary Clintonwho backed McCrystal's request for additional troops in Afghanistan.Some of the strongest criticism was reserved for Richard Holbrooke Obama's special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan."The boss says he's like a wounded animal" a member of the general's team is quoted as saying."Holbrooke keeps hearing rumorsthat he's going to get fired so that makes him dangerous."McChrystal was quoted as saying he felt "betrayed" by the leak of a classified cable from U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan KarlEikenberry last year.The cable raised doubts about sending more troops to shore up an Afghan government already lacking incredibility."I like Karl I've known him for years but they'd never said anything like that to us before"McChrystal was quoted as saying in thearticle."Here's one that covers his flank for the history books. Now if we fail they can say 'I told you so."(Editing by Washington World Desk)Copyright Â© 2010 Yahoo! Inc. All rights reserved. And from the WSJ:0 JUNE 21 2010 6:55 PM ETMcChrystal's Next Offensive?Relations between the U.S. military and civilians in the Obama administration have been tense since last year's three-month review of Afghan war strategy a state of affairsunlikely to be helped by a new profile of Gen. Stanley McChrystal the overall commander in Afghanistan that will appear in Rolling Stone magazine on Friday. In the eight-page article released to reporters on Monday ahead of publication McChrystal appears to belittle Vice President Joe Biden and accuses Karl Eikenberry the U.S.ambassador to Kabul of undermining his war plan within the administration. Asked by the Rolling Stone reporter about what he now feels of the war strategy advocated by Biden last fall â fewer troops more drone attacks â the article reports thatMcChrystal and his aides attempted to come up with a good one-liner to dismiss the question. "Are you asking about Vice President Biden?"McChrystal reportedly jokes. "Who'sthat?"Later in the article McChrystal turns more serious when asked about cables sent last fall to Washington by Eikenberry. The cables called into question the major troop increaseadvocated by McChrystal's team and the U.S.'s backing of Afghan President Hamid Karzai â views that the ambassador had not previously raised with McChrystal or his staff."I like Karl I've known him for years but they'd never said anything like that to us before" McChrystal is quoted as saying. "Here's one that covers his flank for the historybooks. Now if we fail they can say 'I told you so."The article titled "The Runaway General" has already caused nervousness inside the Pentagon where memories are still fresh of another blistering profile that got a topcommander in hot water: an August 2008 cover story in Esquire <hop://wvav.esquire.com/features/fox-fallon > on Adm. William "Fox" Fallon then commander of all U.S.forces in the Middle East and Central Asia. The article eventually played a part in Fallon's resignation two years ago. In that Esquire piece however Fallon appeared to directly contradict White House policy on Iran and other parts of the Middle East; the Rolling Stone article makes no suchallegation but rather is full of jokey put-downs of important Washington players. Comments in the article attributed to anonymous McChrystal aides are particularly harsh towards some senior members of the Obama administration including National SecurityAdviser James Jones and other leading politicians like Sens. John Kerry (D. Mass.) and John McCain (R. Ariz). They also make some unflattering references toPresidentBarack Obama himself saying the president didn't seem to know who McChrystal was when he appointed him to run the war early last year. Only Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who is portrayed as having strongly backed McChrystal's plan for Afghanistan is singled out for praise by the anonymous McChrystalaides.

Tensions between General Stanley McChrystal and the White House are on full display in an unflattering profile in Rolling Stone of the commander of USand NATO forces in the Afghan war. McChrystal jokes sarcastically about preparing to answer a question referring to Vice President Joe Biden known as a skeptic of the commander's warstrategy."Are you asking about Vice President Biden?' McChrystal says with a laugh. 'Who's that?'" the article quotes him as saying."Biden?' suggests a top adviser. 'Did you say: Bite Me?"McChrystal tells the magazine that he felt "betrayed" by the US ambassador to Kabul Karl Eikenberry in a White House debate over war strategy last year. Referring to a leaked internal memo from Eikenberry that questioned McChrystal's request for more troops the commander suggested the ambassador hadtried to protect himself for history's sake."I like Karl I've known him for years but they'd never said anything like that to us before" McChrystal tells the magazine."Here's one that covers his flank for the history books. Now if we fail they can say ?I told you so."Eikenberry himself a former commander in Afghanisan had written to the White House saying Afghan President Hamid Karzai was an unreliable partnerand that a surge of troops could draw the United States into a open-ended quagmire. The article revisits the friction between the White House and the military last fall as Obama debated whether to grant McChrystal's request for tens ofthousands of reinforcements. Although Obama in the end granted most of what McChrystal asked for the strategy review was a difficult time the general tells the magazine."I found that time painful" McChrystal says. "I was selling an unsellable position."An unnamed adviser to McChrystal alleges the general came away unimpressed after a meeting with Obama in the Oval Office a year ago just after thepresident named him to take over in Afghanistan."It was a 10-minute photo op" the general's adviser says."Obama clearly didn?t know anything about him who he was.. he didn?t seem very engaged."The boss was pretty disappointed" says the adviser. The profile titled "The Runaway General" portrays his aides as profane and intensely loyal to McChrystal while arguing the general has seized control overthe war on the military and diplomatic fronts. The four-star general also derides the hard-charging top US envoy to the region Richard Holbrooke and complains about a dinner with an unnamed Frenchminister during a visit to Paris."Oh not another e-mail from Holbrooke" McChrystal says looking at his messages on a mobile phone. "I don't even want to open it."In a hotel room in Paris getting ready for a dinner with a French official McChrystal says: "How'd I get screwed into going to this dinner?""The dinner comes with the position sir" says his aide Colonel Charlie Flynn."Hey Charlie"McChrystal says "does this come with the position?"McChrystal gives him the middle finger.Copyright Â© 2010 AFP.All rights reserved",0,0,0

578,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am the expert director heading Investments and Portfolio Management in the above-mentioned firm in Switerland.I am contacting you in view of an urgent assistance to carry out a pending transaction, which will develop a cordial business relationship between you and me.One of my clients whom I have personally managed his portfolio for 10 years now was a victim of a fatal car crash.His name is Late Mr Saud Ed Abad AlKharj, he was survived by a fiance and a two-year-old son from her as they intended getting married but where trying to be cautious because of Islamic law attitude on adultery.This were his only family and no next of kin, as he was the only child of Late Sheikh Hamza Al Kharj Al Faisal, who received royalties from the Kuwaiti Government on one of his fields which oil was discovered and subsequently explored (the Al Jazriah Oil Field).All subsequent investigation to find a next of kin was privately conducted by me and was futile.It was at this juncture that I and other officials Managing his portfolio and 2 bank managers where he had his accounts now decided to make this proposal and transfer ownership of the portfolio to an Agreeing party as beneficiary to the portfolio of the deceased.The reason why ownership cannot be transferred to his wife to be and only son is that Islamic law will not recognize such and if an attempt is made on that it may put her in trouble with the authorities for giving birth outside marriage.So we have decided to help her by making this proposal and making sure she gets a substantial part of Late Mr Saud Alkharjï¿½s property for her and her son.You must be asking where I got your mail address, it was made available to me by a junior director Mrs Cynthia Philips in charge of customer services on request for contacts for investment expansion for a client but she is not aware of this contact.All records and accounts regarding the assets of deceased were managed by me for 10 years running, if you are interested to assist us, all I will do is to incorporate in the old records recognizing you as the only beneficiary.The banking law here stipulates that if such portfolio remains unclaimed after four years it will go to the public department.The need for a foreigner as beneficiary is occasioned by the fact that the deceased was not permanently resident in Switzerland.For your assistance, we made up of I, 2 senior directors in my firm and 2 bank managers in banks which the Kuwaiti Government pay royalties, accruing to the deceased have agreed in fairness to make available 25% of all bank funds cleared and 15% of the royalties which you will continue to receive on behalf of the deceased as sole beneficiary every year.However we do not intend to share any interest with you as far as the estates and property are concerned, as they will be going to the surviving wife and child.If you are okay with the above explanations, you may reply us including all your contact telephone and fax numbers so that we may confirm you genuine, after which we will make more information available to you on how we will proceed.I must further assure you that this transaction is 100% legitimate and the modalities for this transaction is being handled by top executives which assure a risk free transaction.Kindly visit my firms website at www.royaltrust.com.We await your timely response.Best Regards DR PETER CLAPTON",1,1,0

I write you this proposal in good faith, believing =that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you.I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On June =5th, 2000, a German  business tycoon Mr. Andreas Schranner made a (Fixed =deposit) for 60 calendar months, valued at  US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen =Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen  to be =his account officer before I was moved to my present position recently.The =maturity date for this deposit contract was last 3rd of April 2005.Before =this date, I have tried my possible best to locate a Next of Kin to late Mr. =Schranner, but all efforts prooved abortive, because all his family, =including his Son In-Law and children died in the plane crash of Concorde Air =France Flight AF4590 which took place on 25th July 2000, some months after he =did the deposit in my bank.You can read more stories about the plane crash =by visiting this website, http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stmWith the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to =support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E.  By =end of October this year, the Government will pass a new Financial Control =Law which will give the Government authority to interrogate account owners of =above $5 million Dollars to explain the source of the funds, making sure it =is not for terrorism support.If I do not move this money out of the country =immediately, by October the Government will definitely confiscate the money, =because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source of the =money since he is late.I decided to utilize this life time opportunity, instead of Government =confiscating the, but I cannot directly claim the money without the help of a =foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance.As the =Account Officer to late Mr. Schranner, coupled with my present position and =status in the bank, I have the power to influence the release of the funds to =any foreigner that comes up as the Next of Kin to the account, with the =correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you.I am =having the secret Code for the account, which only the account owner of his =Next of Kin can know.I shall supply all necessary information we need for the claim and there is =practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a =legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside =U.A. E is porous and anything goes.If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share =the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied.I shall =explain to you in details how we shall handle the transaction once I receive =your response.Thanking you in advance and May God blesses you.Please, treat with utmost =confidentiality.I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to =Mr.Schranner when the deposit was made for your perusal.I wait your urgent response.Regards,Ali Raza Khan.--451eb171-5830-4e19-b191-5cfa09b077dd--",1,1,0
