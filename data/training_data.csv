The names are also used to refer to acorpse or hospital patient whose identity is unknown. This practice is widely used in the United States and Canada, but is rarely used in other English-speaking countries including the United Kingdom itself, from where the use of "John Doe" in a legal context originates. The names Joe Bloggs or John Smith are used in the UK instead, as well as in Australia and New Zealand.John Doe is sometimes used to refer to a typical male in other contexts as well, in a similar manner to John Q. Public, known in Great Britain as Joe Public, John Smith or Joe Bloggs. For example, the first name listed on a form is often John Doe, along with a fictional address or other fictional information to provide an example of how to fill in the form. The name is also used frequently in popular culture, for example in the Frank Capra film Meet John Doe. John Doe was also the name of a 2002 American television series.Similarly, a child or baby whose identity is unknown may be referred to as Baby Doe. A notorious murder case in Kansas City, Missouri, referred to the baby victim as Precious Doe. Other unidentified female murder victims are Cali Doe and Princess Doe. Additional persons may be called James Doe, Judy Doe, etc. However, to avoid possible confusion, if two anonymous or unknown parties are cited in a specific case or action, the surnames Doe and Roe may be used simultaneously; for example, "John Doe v. Jane Roe". If several anonymous parties are referenced, they may simply be labelled John Doe #1, John Doe #2, etc. (the U.S. Operation Delego cited 21 (numbered) "John Doe"s) or labelled with other variants of Doe / Roe / Poe / etc. Other early alternatives such as John Stiles and Richard Miles are now rarely used, and Mary Major has been used in some American federal cases.File created by http://www.online-convert.comMore example files: http://www.online-convert.com/file-typeText of Example content: Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doe)License: Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)Feel free to use and share the file according to the license above.--------------050008080707050500070109Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit<html>  <head>    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">  </head>  <body text="#000000" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">    <font style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2"> </font><b><font        color="#660b23" face="Arial"> </font></b> <font      style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2">      <div style="POSITION: relative"><h2>EML test file</h2>Purpose: Provide example of this file type<br>Document file type: EML<br>Version: 1.0<br>Remark:<br><br>Example content:<br>The names "<b>John Doe</b>" for males, "<b>Jane Doe</b>" or "<b>Jane Roe</b>" for females, or "Jonnie Doe" and "Janie Doe" for children, or just "Doe" non-gender-specifically are used as placeholder names for a party whose true identity is unknown or must be withheld in a legal action, case, or discussion.

And they share a                                           deep pride that goes with being from the south" --George Mooney, the                                           irreplaceable "Voice of the Volunteers" in the 1950s                                           "The true football fan pays no attention to time or mileage when there is a                                           big game to see." --John Heisman, head coach, Auburn University                                           "In Baton Rouge, the focal point of everything is Tiger football." --Jim                                           Corbett                                           "In Baton Rouge, it's not a law to love LSU, but the city fathers could                                           probably get one passed if they needed to." --Charles McClendon, head                                           coach, LSU                                           "After so many years at a school, you become a member of the football                                           family." --Bob Fulton                                           "I don't care where a man comes from or how he spells his name. All I                                           ask is that he be loyal to Georgia, proud of that jersey, and try like the                                           devil to win." --Wally Butts, head coach, Georgia                                           "Deep inside, we're still the boys of autumn, that magic time of the year                                           that once swept us on to America's fields." --Archie Manning                                           "Tradition is a rich asset for any team. Tradition and success are traveling                                           companions." --Wallace Wade, head coach, University of Alabama                                           The above quotes were excerpted from Criswell Freeman's "The                                           Wisdom of Southern Football" (1995).                                           As football season creeps ever closer, the avid enthusiast finds it difficult                                           to contain the unbridled excitement and anticipation that bubbles like                                           summertime sweat within their pigskin-thirsty souls. Football season is                                           that special time of year that not only means the beginning of another                                           healthy slate of competitive gridiron contests filled with spectacular plays                                           and high drama--it's also the definitive rallying point for the onslaught of                                           all the expected pomp, pageantry, and circumstance that goes                                           hand-in-hand with the college game. In no conference in the country is                                           this statement more true than the tradition-rich Southeastern Conference.                                           The ongoing rivalries, the colorful histories and traditions, the premier                                           tailgating, the coquettish southern bells in their gameday garb, the reunion                                           of lasting friendships, and the competitive fire and spirit that accompany                                           the game, all make the entire SEC football experience a very real, and                                           visceral one--even to the most casual observer.                                            The Southeastern Conference is unequivocally the paragon of the college                                           football conferences, and the 2000 season figures not to disappoint the                                           thousands of rabid fans that flock to the stadiums each week throughout                                           the southeast; as well as the millions more who tune in from home on the                                           tube to follow their respective teams. Quite frankly, SEC football has                                           never been bigger, or better. The southern cultural phenomenon only                                           continues to grow with each passing season. The number of fans, and the                                           competition that they long for each and every weekend of the football                                           season, has never been bigger or better. In 1999, the SEC again set                                           attendance records for its games, and with the many recent expansions to                                           existing stadiums in the conference, those records should again fall at the                                           end of this season.                                            Five Reasons Tiger Fans Can Be Excited About the 2000 Football                                           Season                                           1. Lou Tepper is no longer in Tiger Town.                                           Heralded by professional defensive coaches as a "guru" and a "defensive                                           genius" prior to his arrival at LSU, the former Illinois head coach led the                                           LSU defense to its worst two-year performance in the history of the                                           school (1893). If you are interested in immortalizing the Tepper legacy at                                           LSU for your scrapbook, copies of his book "Complete Linebacking"                                           can still be obtained (at a discounted price no less) at most local book                                           outlets. In Tepper's absence, maybe the Tigers will return to the days of                                           coach Charlie Mac and the standout defensive units that were his                                           trademark while at the Ole War Skule. Speaking of Coach Mac, I caught                                           up with him last week at his home and he sounded as spry as a spring                                           chicken. He told me that he is doing great and that he enjoys cycling in                                           the mornings to stay in shape. Coach told me that he hopes that the LSU                                           players have fun this year, because, he said, "...having fun is what it's all                                           about. If you can't have any fun, you're in big trouble."                                           2. Contrary to popular belief, the Tigers are deep at quarterback.                                           Preseason prognosticators have cited the injury to Rohan Davey as a                                           core reason why the Tigers will have trouble at the quarterback position.                                           They all opined early that both Booty and Nall had difficulties leading the                                           offense and that the injury to Davey was a major setback to the Tiger                                           offense. However, reports from summer camp indicate that Rohan is now                                           within 95-100 percent of his normal range of motion on his knee, and in                                           light of this it would appear that the Tigers are again three-deep at the                                           quarterback position. The resurgence of Rohan is a tremendous boost to                                           the team. Known for his leadership ability both on and off the field,                                           Rohan possesses the true grit that wins ball games. I caught up with                                           former LSU All-American and coach Gaynell Tinsley at his Highland                                           Road home a few weeks ago, and he told me that he thought that                                           Rohan's performance against Arkansas was the best he had ever seen by                                           an LSU quarterback. True frosh Marcus Randall impressed in the LA                                           High School All-Star game last week, but he is a likely redshirt with the                                           logjam of experienced competition ahead of him.                                           3. Nick Saban.                                           Derided unfairly early by most SEC media outlets as being "incompatible"                                           with Louisianians' unique culture and high football expectations, Saban is                                           easily the best thing to happen to LSU football since Kevin Faulk. A                                           consummate professional, Saban exudes confidence and paints a clear                                           vision for the future of the program. His presence in Red Stick has made                                           an immediate impact on the program, evidenced by the recent glowing                                           comments at media days by seniors Louis William and Fred Booker.                                           Saban was also unfairly chastised heavily by the media for his inability to                                           bring any assistants with him to LSU from his previous staff at Michigan                                           State. However, Coach Saban recently aptly stated at the SEC media                                           days that only a couple of his previous staff members had ever been                                           "south of the Mason-Dixon line." That notwithstanding, you cannot argue                                           with the fact that Saban has compiled a great staff of southern coaches.                                           Tiger fans should find further solace in the fact that coach Saban has                                           never had a losing record as a football coach.                                           4. Trev Faulk & Bradie James at Linebacker.                                           All good defenses have a common trait--great linebacking play, and you'll                                           be hard-pressed to find two better young horses than these two. Outside                                           linebacker and pass rushing specialist Jeremy Lawrence is another super                                           sophomore to keep your eyes on. These guys all have good wheels, and                                           will put the leather on you when they get the chance. James' number 11                                           Faulk's recent acquisition of Mealey's lucky 7 will undoubtedly prompt                                           many fans and commentators to make countless puns and jokes related                                           to LSU's 7-11 linebacking duo.                                           5. Predictions Don't Mean Diddly                                           The other day I was scouring through the many rolls of microfilm in the                                           basement of Middleton Library at LSU, and I stumbled upon this most                                           interesting fact:                                            In August, 1958, LSU was picked to finish 8th out of 10 SEC teams.                                           Auburn, which had won the national championship the year prior with                                           Shug Jordan, was picked to repeat as conference champs, followed by                                           Ole Miss and Mississippi State.                                            Of course, in spite of the dismal preseason ranking by the SEC                                           sportswriters, the Bengal Tigers went on to record their only unblemished                                           season and national college football championship to date. This story                                           should only serve to encourage fans that are despondent over the                                           outcome of the past two seasons in Tigertown. Anything can happen in                                           the SEC, and remember, the old adage says that "history repeats itself."                                           Keep the faith Tigerfans!                                           Until next time...",0,0,0

As far as use of the WSCC data goes, I noticed that you've got table entries and are showing '0' values for a  lot of plants that have never reported reliably, such as Hermiston, Gadsby, Priest Rapids, Wanapum, etc.-- I'd leave those out until we see some plausible data reported. Also, we don't use data from plants where better numbers are available from other sources, e.g. most Pacific Northwest federal hydro.Also, are you doing anything to filter out bad hours? There are intermittent periods where series of zeros or series of identical readings are erroneously reported due to telemetry failures. If you're computing totals or averages from the WSCC data that are consistently smaller than known, accurate reports, then this might be the cause.TimMatthew Lenhart07/05/2000 01:59 PMTo: Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tim Heizenrader/PDX/ECT@ECT, Cooper Richey/PDX/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Enclosed is a copy of the generation reports we put together using your generation database.

223,"Stephanie, Transwestern has been in discussions with ENA since very early December regarding the sale of the Enron Compression Services gas. The ECS off take is supposed to be 11,000 per day. The fact that ECS was not able to nominate their gas has been problematic for Transwestern in that it causes our line pack to be higher than it otherwise would be. When we began discussions, we were open to the idea of getting the full volume out of our system by the end of the month. If a nomination could have been made that resulted in a sale starting at the beginning of this week, ECS could have sold the entire 363,000 in December. At some point, it becomes unrealistic to expect to be able to do that. It has taken ECS so long to arrange for an agent that a now we are looking at selling the entire volume in just 12 days (~30,000/day). I was expecting the following two things from ENA, 1) confirmation from you that ECS was set up to sell their gas, and 2) a start date for a sale with some advanced notice. I would then have conferred with operations to see if it would be possible to move the entire 363,000 in December. I did not expect ENA to arrange the sale before circling back with TW. If I had known that you were about to close a sale, I could have arranged to be pulled out of my meetings Tuesday afternoon. I have advised Patti Sullivan that TW is able to deliver 25,000/d through the end of the month. The balance can be delivered in January. I am confident that things will run smoother in the future. Regards, Paul -----Original Message-----From: Miller, Stephanie Sent: Tuesday, December 18, 2001 8:24 PMTo: Y'barbo, PaulCc: Tholt, Jane M.; Boyt, Eric; Nemec, Gerald; Gay, Randall L.Subject: TWPL ImbalanceGreetings Paul: Eric Boyt advised that TWPL was not in a position to deliver the full volume of approx. 363,000 mmbtu for the remainder of the month for the account of Enron Compression Services.  This would have been good information to know BEFORE we sold the gas.  I left a couple of messages today but never heard from you.  Unfortunately, we have sold this volume, at your repeated request, and are not in a position to retrade the deal.  To the extent TWPL is unable to perform, please call Janie Tholt or Randy Gay to see if they can reduce the commited volume. I am scheduled to be out tomorrow but may have to come in for the afternoon. Please advise ASAP. Ragards, Stephaniex31688",0,1,0

The total costs for all the projects amount to over $13 million. For every dollar of State funding, the participating agencies have earmarked an average of $5 each to achieve long term success in promoting alternatives to petroleum fuels. The Energy Commission's grant funding will also reduce the public agencies' alternative fuel cost by about $1.3 million over three years.Grant winners under the Commission's Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Program were: the City of Los Angeles, $250,000; City of Fresno, $250,000; City of Industry, through City of Industry Disposal Company, $196,427; City of Placentia, $225,000; City of Commerce, $250,000; County Sanitation District of Los Angeles, $250,000; the City of Temecula Rapid Transit Agency, County of Riverside, Rancho California Water District and CR&R Solid Waste Management through Downs Commercial Fueling, $250,000; The California Department of Transportation, San Luis Obispo County, California State University Channel Islands, California Polytechnic San Luis Obispo, Lucia Mar School District, City of Solvang and Santa Inez Transportation Company, through Delta Liquid Energy, $250,000; City of Colton, $250,000; and Southwest Transportation Agency in Riverdale, $150,000.The Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Program seeks to displace petroleum-based motor fuels and assist California in attaining health-based air quality standards. Top priority for the program is to deploy low-emission alternative fuel vehicles, especially for cities, counties, local educational agencies, State fleets and project participants of the Interstate Clean Transportation Corridor (ICTC).# # #For further information, contact:City of Los Angeles						Detrich B.

You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.  Parking & Transportation Desk3-7060",0,0,1

243,"Salt River Project, in an effort to bring resolution to the mainline andreceipt point allocation issues pending in the above-captioned proceedings,is filing today (and serving hard copies of) the attached "Motion of SRP forAdoption of Strawman Alternative to March 28, 2000 Proposal of El PasoNatural Gas Company".  Unlike any other proposal before it, it seeks toweave into one workable solution, the concerns raised by shippers in theirinitial and reply comments filed in the Order 637 proceeding, as well asaddress the 3 complaints.  It is a share-the-pain proposal among CD -Converted FR - and El Paso.  Under it, FR shippers would convert to CDs atlevels reflecting actual usage over the past 5 years, weighted to thepresent. It assures each westward flowing firm shipper, based on the currentphysical mainline capacity (including L. 2000), 93.1%(winter) and 94.2%(summer) of their contractual entitlement.  On a daily basis, all westwardFT shippers are assured of receiving approximately 60% of their 93.1 and94.2% allocation from the San Juan.  FT-2 shippers would continue to beserved off the top.  This Strawman adopts the in-line pooling methodologyset forth in SoCal Gas' initial comments.  It includes North and Southsystem segmentation rights, and narrowly defined demand charge credits forunprovided capacity as long as there is a shortfall.  Provision is made toencourage turn-back of capacity and to have capacity under expired contractsdedicated by El Paso to meeting the approximately 7% shortfall. Provision isalso made to treat each primary delivery point as a receipt point, and togive priority to Alternate Receipt- to- Primary Delivery point in thesystemwide scheduling process, all intended to encourage a strongsupplemental market to meet peak seasonal needs.This Strawman Alternative is not filed as an offer of settlement, but as abasis for a merits decision, eliminating the need for lengthy evidentiaryhearings, and providing certainty and flexibility to the system onceimplemented.  Alternatively, we have left it to the Commission to decidewhether other procedures should be adopted.  Because it is a motion, it maybe responded to within 15 days of filing.  SRP strongly urges each shipperand state commission to contact SRP for answers to any questions beforetaking a position in response to the motion.  Any shipper that has questionsbut does not seek answers, but merely sticks to their litigation positionwill only be delaying resolution. This proposal is a viablecompromise...everyone gains and everyone loses something.  That is why itworks.  We look forward to hearing from you and reading your constructivecomments.

249,"------------------------------------------------------------------------NEWS RELEASEFROM THECALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION------------------------------------------------------------------------For immediate release: December 19, 2001Contact: Mary Ann Costamagna - 916-654-4989Energy Commission Releases Second Part ofMorro Bay Power Plant Staff AnalysisSacramento - The second part of the Final Staff Assessment of the Morro Bay Modernization and Replacement Project is now available from the California Energy Commission. Both parts one and two can be viewed on the Energy Commission's website at:www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/morrobay/Part two of the Morro Bay project Final Staff Assessment contains the Commission staff evaluation of the potential impacts on land use, cultural, soil and water resources. The analysis, required by the California Environmental Quality Act, is based on input from the public, local, state and federal agencies. The Final Staff Assessment does not represent a decision or proposed decision on the project.Like part one, part two of the Final Staff Assessment makes no recommendation on the proposed project. In late January, Commission staff will release part three of the Final Staff Assessment. Part three will analyze the proposal's impact on biological resources, cooling tower options and project alternatives once staff receives necessary information from various, federal, state and local agencies. It will also contain staff's recommendation on the project.Duke Energy, LLC filed an Application for Certification for the Morro Bay Modernization and Replacement Project with the California Energy Commission on October 23, 2000. The proposal would replace the existing 1,030-megawatt Morro Bay Power Plant units 1, 2, 3 and 4 with two, state-of-the-art, gas-fired, 600-megawatt, combined-cycle units, generating a total of 1,200 megawatts. Each new unit will consist of two gas-fired turbines and one steam turbine with two 145-foot-tall stacks. The total of four new stacks would replace the existing power plant's three stacks that are 450 feet tall.Hearings giving the public and interested parties a chance to comment on part two of the Staff Assessment will be announced in the next few weeks.Public participation is an important part of the Energy Commission's power plant certification process. People may get involved in a variety of ways. To find out how, contact the Energy Commission's Public Adviser, Roberta Mendonca, at 916-654-4489, toll free at 800-822-6228 or by e-mail at: pao@energy.state.ca.us .* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *To unsubscribe from this list, please go to:http://www.energy.ca.gov/listservers/Or simply send an e-mail to majordomo@energy.ca.govand in the body of the e-mail, type inunsubscribe (name of this list)* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Farideh NamjouWeb Development TeamCalifornia Energy Commission916-654-4989* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *",0,0,0

The human polls are counted>along with computer rankings, the strength of schedule is>factored in, and teams are penalized for losses and>credited for victories over better teams.

Can anyone honestly>say undefeated Miami versus Nebraska (11-1) is not the best>matchup for the national title game?>>Now Colorado Coach Gary Barnett and the Buffaloes' faithful>are trying to say it is not.>>Yes, Colorado (10-2) beat the Cornhuskers handily and went>on to win the Big 12 championship.>>The Buffaloes also lost two games, one to Fresno State, a>fine team with a future pro quarterback in David Carr. But>Fresno State did not even win the Western Athletic>Conference title; Louisiana Tech did. The Bulldogs posted>an 11-2 record by beating league teams like Tulsa, Southern>Methodist, Nevada and San Jose State - a group that>finished with a combined 11-34 record.>>The Buffaloes are beating their chests about holding off>Texas, 39-37, in the conference championship game, but the>Longhorns rolled over Colorado by 41-7 earlier in the>season. One loss in a season when there are not two>undefeated teams is understandable; rewarding two losses>would be absurd.>>Colorado did not earn a trip to the Rose Bowl. If the>Buffaloes beat Oregon in the Fiesta Bowl and Nebraska>upends top-ranked Miami in the title game, shame on any>voter in the Associated Press news media poll who decides>that Colorado (11-2) is more deserving of the No. 1 ranking>than Nebraska (12-1).>>Oregon (10-1), on the other hand, has a right to feel>slighted. The Ducks can also be heartened that a>Miami-lose, Oregon-win scenario might earn them the A.P.'s>top ranking.>>The Ducks, who only lost to a very good 9-2 Stanford team,>are ranked No. 2 in both the A.P. and USA Today/ESPN>coaches polls. The strength-of-schedule and computer>component of the B.C.S. formula did Oregon in. The won-lost>records of opponents and opponents' opponents don't lie.>For Oregon, those numbers add up to the nation's>31st-toughest schedule compared to Nebraska's 14th-ranked>schedule.>>Even if you dislike or don't understand the computer>rankings, they account for only 25 percent of the B.C.S.>formula. Oregon was ranked as high as No. 2 by one>computer, and as low as No. 8 by another. Both were thrown>out, as the formula requires, and the remaining six>computer service rankings were averaged. Oregon's>average-point total was 4.83, which means the computers>rated it as the fourth- or fifth-best team in the nation.>>The math is essentially the short way of telling you what>an hour of reviewing Oregon's season game recaps spell out:>the Ducks struggled to beat decent but hardly great>opponents.>>Six of their games were decided by 7 points or fewer. In>four games, the margin was 3 or fewer. The Ducks had to>persevere against Wisconsin (5-7), Southern California>(6-5), U.C.L.A. (7-4) and Oregon State (5-6).>>Without the moral authority of the No. 2 ranking in the>human polls, Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti and the Ducks' fans>would assume the same gracious (and silent) posture as the>coaches and partisans at Illinois and Maryland, both also>10-1. They would celebrate their fine season at a>high-profile bowl game, regret their single loss and admit>that a down year in their respective conferences cost them>a trip to the big game.>>And how about that moral authority? After Tennessee lost to>Louisiana State last Saturday, the coaching colleagues of>Nebraska's Frank Solich changed their votes in favor of>Barnett and Colorado to try to keep the Cornhuskers out of>the title game.>>Say what you want about computers and formulas, but doesn't>it bother you that the human component of the B.C.S.>formula is the only one that can willfully corrupt the>integrity of the standing?>>Beyond Colorado and Oregon, the loudest whining is coming>from the college playoff proponents, many of whom are A.P.>poll voters. Fortunately, they too account for 25 percent>of the B.C.S. standing.>>. . .>>So far, university presidents have emphatically shot down>any playoff structure. Wisely, in my opinion. Would the>last three weeks with losses by Nebraska to Colorado,>Oklahoma to Oklahoma State, Texas to Colorado, Florida to>Tennessee, and Tennessee to L.S.U. have been as urgent or>dramatic if you knew many of these teams were going to tee>it up again in a week or two and commence a round-robin?>>Of all the major sports, only college football offers a>regular season that matters. Expanded playoffs in the pro>sports and even the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament>give fans cues when to pay attention. In college football,>you pay attention from August on because the playoff is>under way.>>The B.C.S. standing was created to ensure that the best two>teams met in a title game, which wasn't always guaranteed.>Tennessee-Florida State? Virginia Tech-Florida State?>Oklahoma-Florida State? The past three B.C.S. title games>resulted in an undisputed national champion.>>Cut through all the noise, and in Nebraska you'll find a>team that won 11 straight by 10 points or more. Yes,>Nebraska's loss was ugly and it came in the season finale,>which pollsters, for some reason, have historically found>abhorrent. Yet Nebraska has one fewer loss than Colorado>and has faced better competition than Oregon.>>You may not like the B.C.S. formula, but it is fair.>Whether you calculate by abacus or algorithms.

261,"With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.In efforts to minimize confusion, we will convert all Stentofon addresses in EB1 to a 4000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then your new number will be 4364.)  We will also change all speed dials to reflect the new dialing scheme.

Kidsave,s  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child. In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work. Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments. We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston,s  Kidsave program.   Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.

283,"Current Notes User:REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook client will be configured on your computer.After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook client is configured on your desktop.2. Remote access to your mailbox.After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) for remote access to your mailbox.PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA available from your home or when traveling abroad.HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doeSubstitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You will now be able to view your mailbox. PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the functions NOT available via OWA:Features NOT available using OWA:-  Tasks-  Journal-  Spell Checker-  Offline Use-  Printing Templates-  Reminders-  Timed Delivery-  Expiration-  Outlook Rules-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall-  Sharing Contacts with others-  Task Delegation-  Direct Resource Booking-  Personal Distribution ListsQUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at: Outlook.2000@enron.comOtherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at: 713-853-1411Thank you,Outlook 2000 Migration Team",1,0,1

320,"Been pretty busy these last couple of weeks.Couple of weeks ago I had to go to Los Angeles on short notice.  Accordingly, paid full price and got in first class.  It must have been a new plane because the first class section was huge.  I sat in a chair that was like a lazy boy chair-it had a fott recline and everything.  Also had my own pop up TV and could watch  my choice of 4 movies.  It was truly awesome.  Can't believe what  a small world it is. Went to lobby to get somebreakfast and Patrick Brown was there-ended up having breakfast with him and some ohter Sempra folks.Then I had to go to Vegas a couple of weeks ago.  Stayed at the new Alladin Hotel.  They upgraded me to a suite.  Another great experience.  Bathroom was huge.  Big marble shower and  a  big tub that overlooked the skyline.  Bedroom area and sitting area were nice too.  Shame I was only there one night.Last week was Gas Fair.  Lots of lunches and dinners. There are a lot of new restaurants downtown that we tried out.  Yum-yum. The weather was perfect.  .  Cheri and I went to the spa and had a relaxing afternoon on the last day.  She looks great.  She said you saw her picture of Matthew. He's a cutie.  Parks was a t dinner one night-he hasn't changed-still nice as ever.  Had a lot of fun with Frank Fields too- he hasn't changed a bit .David Livingston was there.  He works for Cinergy but is doing east coast stuff-thank God.  Our retail group  just hired Joe Deschamps and Chris Shireman-remember them?  I bet Joe won't be there by the end of the year-I think he just wanted someone to pay for his way back to Houston.  Just found out that Bob Shiring went to work for Pan Canadian doing east coast stuff.Joe's brother was in town this week-end from Montana.  He picked him up in San Antonio so we had them all week-end .  Went down to Kemah to watch the boats- we went there with Griff that one time.  Boy has it changed.  Tons more stuff to do -especially for the kids.I'm just sick over my tax bill this year.  I exercised a ton of my options-and boy am I paying for it.  I was planning on  maybe paying $25000  but I am having to pay $47000.  Will probably be that way next year too.  Just sucks that the government takes so much.  I know I'm probably not getting much sympathy from you but I can try.Can't believe there was another shooting in your area last week.  Bet you are glad your kids are almost out of school.  Can't understand how these kids have access to all of these guns.  It's scary.Deb and I had lunch with Julia.   She's gone from Enron now.  She did not give us any more details about her marriage other than she got married out of town and in am place that made it difficult to track marriage l icense.  Her family still does not know she is married.  She is being really strange about this whole thing. She qwon't acknowledge to anyone that she is married.  I've given up on her.  She is almost as strange as you at times.

The temperature was about 35 degrees and it wasn't windy-so it was just a great day to walk the streets and take in all the snow.  It just felt like Christmas.  We took a  carriage ride around Central Park and they dropped us off at Tavern on the Green for lunch.  Met one of my contacts at Prebon for lunch and he  paid for it. .  Good  thing because we were drinking mimosas at $10.00 a pop.  We saw two great plays-Aida and the Lion King.  Excellent. Actually, Aida may be the best broadway play I have ever seen.  The music was awesome.  Lion King had great special effects with all of the costumes. The people were dressed like animals and it was really cool.    Prebon got us tickets for that too-first row-center section-mezz. level.  In other words-perfect seats.  On Saturday, we mostly shopped during the day.  Deb bought herself a new David Yurman diamond ring  and red leathe coat. You can't believe the people that were shopping.  We went to FAO Schwartz early-9:00 a.m.-and at 3:00 the line was clear around the building to get in.  The large department stores were like that too-hoards of people.  You could hardly walk down 5th avenue, it was so crowded.  I have never seen so many mink coats in my life.  Everyone had one on.  The hotel we stayed at was excellent.  It didn't have the view you did.  Nothing will ever match that.  But all three of us stayed in one room and the room was huge and nicely decorated.  All three of us were able to get ready in a span of one hour.  We ate at some good restaurants too.  The first night was this small Italian restaurant.  Very authentic.  They took good care of us.  The second night was Thai-food was excellent.  The third day was French.  YUM YUM.  We got out of town just in time.  We really lucked out.
