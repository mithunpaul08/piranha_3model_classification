31,"Current Notes User:  REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)  1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook  client will be configured on your computer.After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail  via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is  configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is  migrated.During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your  web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and  To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook  client is configured on your desktop.2. Remote access to your mailbox.After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA)  for remote access to your mailbox.PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while  connecting to the Enron network (LAN).There are future plans to make OWA  available from your home or when traveling abroad.HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)  Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:   http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe  Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.You  will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.Type in "corp/your user  id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.You  will now be able to view your mailbox.PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between  the Outlook and OWA clients.You will not be able to do many of the things  in OWA that you can do in Outlook.Below is a brief list of *some* of the  functions NOT available via OWA:  Features NOT available using OWA:  -  Tasks -  Journal -  Spell Checker -  Offline Use -  Printing Templates -  Reminders -  Timed Delivery -  Expiration -  Outlook Rules -  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall -  Sharing Contacts with others -  Task Delegation -  Direct Resource Booking -  Personal Distribution Lists  QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the  Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:   Outlook.2000@enron.com  Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:   713-853-1411  Thank you,  Outlook 2000 Migration Team",1,0,1

33,"Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats.The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com.We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname).Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format.It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com.For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards.If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks.Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format.If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.Enron Messaging Administration",1,0,1

62,"Dear Friend,Greetings to you.I wish to accost you with a request that would be of immense benefit to both of us.Being an executor of wills, it is possible that we may be tempted to make fortune out of our client's situations, when we cannot help it, or left with no better option.The issue I am presenting to you is a case of my client who willed a fortune to his next-of-kin.It was most unfortunate that he and his next-of-kin died on the same day the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board.You can confirm this from the website below which was published by BBC WORLD NEWS.WEBSITE.http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm.I am now faced with confusion of who to pass the fortune to.According to the English law, the fortune is supposed to be bequeathed to the government,if nobody comes forward as the next of kin within seven years of the demise of the benefactor of the will.My purpose of contacting you is to seek your acting as the beneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the legacy of $7million, which my deceased client  bequeathed to his next-of-kin.For now, I alone know about his will, as my client had great confidence in me.Everything will be left between you and I.The share would be 25% for you and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the tsunami victims,as this is my primary objective.All I have to do is amend the will or add a codicil to make you the beneficiary to the $7million legacy.Again, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider this amount too big for you to defend.It does not matter, as there are documents to back it up.This is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-kin.As I am not very sure of getting your consent on the issue I prefer not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being disbarred.The English Bar considers it a breach of the oath of the English Bar.I need not emphasize to you that the sensitivity of this issue need not be toyed with by neglecting its confidentiality.I therefore appeal to you not discuss this request with anybody, even if you decline my request.I look forward to hearing from you soon.Yours trulyStephen Ayling.",1,0,0

I have an urgent business suggestion for you.I honestly apologize and hope I do not cause you much embarrassment by contacting you through this means for a transaction of this magnitude,but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.Furthermore,due to this issue on my hands now,it became necesary for me to seek your assistance, and it is imperative for me to know your opinionBefore the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Bassem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year.Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him.We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem  did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit.And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank.So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it.What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 5 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem  so that you will be able to receive his funds.WHAT IS TO BE DONE:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful.I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job.After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents.Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning thisissue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incure during the transaction.Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefer you to reach me via my private box, {che_Pui67@yahoo.com.hk} and finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this operation.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind Regards,Mr Cheung Pui.___________________________________________________________________________Mail envoy� par le service WebMail du Site PHP-Nuke- http://www.forcetacticalarmy.com",1,1,0

149,"Hi Sidney,We have provided several notifications to you of your current balance with Blacksburg Smiles Dentistry. You did not show up for your dentist appointment which was scheduled for Friday October 22 at 2PM. Unfortunately, our cancellation policy requires 24hrs notice so this incurred a $50 fee which was invoiced to you via mail. We have not received notification of your payment via our online portal, mail, or in person payment options. Unfortunately, if you do not submit the $50 payment, you will be in violation of the patient terms of agreement. There are a number of actions we can take including filing a small claims suit and/or terminating you as a patient.
