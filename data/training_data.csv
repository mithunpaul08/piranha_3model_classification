"I finally got to the point where I'd just take my business plan into a bank  and say, 'I know I'm not going to get a loan - just look at what I've got and  tell me what it needs,' " he said.  Even without a loan in place, Lober began hands-on research. During the week,  he still worked at his father's supply boat business, but flew to Fort  Lauderdale, Fla., on weekends to work as a deck hand and food server for a  charter yacht company to learn the business from the bottom up.  After a year of loan seeking, he found a lender at the Passenger Vessel  Association's annual meeting. Caterpillar Finance agreed to lend him 60  percent of the $950,000 in construction costs if he installed Caterpillar  engines on the boat.  Construction took a year, during which Lober continued his research, serving  drinks on weekends aboard a charter boat on the Detroit River and Lake St.  Clair.  Finally, Lober launched Star Gazer in October 1993.  The maritime academy might have taught him how to navigate by the stars, but  it didn't prepare him for marketing.  "I didn't know what I was doing," Lober said. "The first year, I spent  $125,000 in marketing blunders," including a $50,000 mass mail campaign that  he called "a total flop.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1603,""  Marketing was twice as expensive as he thought it would be and took twice as  long for potential customers to understand the concept he was trying to sell,  he said. Meanwhile, his boat sat in the stall for up to three weeks at a  time.  Lober had a $30,000 monthly overhead in debt service, office rental,  insurance and slip fees, and "I still had to pay it if the boat didn't leave  once," he said.  Panicked, he joined the Greater Houston Partnership to seek out ideas, and he  got one: target marketing.  He and his small staff scrutinized every detail about the people who used the  boat and set out to find more like them. He set his sights on the corporate  client, which makes up about 70 percent of his business today. Corporate  customers include Enron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Continental Airlines and Katy  Mills mall.  "We have had our party with Star Fleet every year for five years," said Ravi  Lal, director of ethylene division of Technip, based in San Dimas, Calif.

1605,""  Business slowly began to build, and word spread. Lober added the 90-foot Star  Cruiser in 1997, the 74-foot Star Spirit in 1999, and brought in a fourth,  the Lake Limo, last month. Also in 1999, he bought 6 acres with 600 feet of  waterfront and built Star Fleet Marina. While part of that land is still  undeveloped, it eventually will become a parking lot for 500 cars when Lober  adds a fifth large yacht, Star Ship, sometime in the future.  "We plan to add Star Ship when we're turning down enough business from the  other boats," he said.  After more than eight years, Lober has yet to take home a salary, putting  everything back into the business.  The more he puts back, the more business he can accommodate.  But Lober and his staff still keep close tabs on their customers.  "We track everything - which individuals, what type of event, whether they  prefer sit-down dinners, how they heard about us - you name it," he said.  It's a lot of details. He knows that blackout shades, pull-down projector  screens and multiple microphone jacks are needed for presentations, and that  some clients like to be picked up at one of the Galveston hotels or other  locations on the Houston Ship Channel.  If a customer hires a deejay, a crewmember provides padding to put underneath  the CD player on the bandstand because dancing on the steel dance floor  causes the player to bounce.  Lober's three full-time cruise consultants handle charter buses to and from  the marina, limos, menus, photographers and decorations. They work with Star  Fleet's in-house florist and theme designer to provide floral arrangements  for sit-down dinners and Hawaiian leis of fresh orchids and hibiscus for a  major retailer's party, for which the florist helped transform the boat's  stanchions into palm trees.  And consultants have their own suggestions, such as bestowing captains' hats  instead of the usual corsages to employees with top sales who were being  honored at a recent floating awards banquet.  Lober believes his company's custom service brings customers back.  "They handle all the details once, and after customers go on that first  cruise, they're sold on the concept," he said. "People love something  different.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1608,""  But cruises aren't limited to parties, Lober said. Customers have chartered  boats for banquets, retreats, new product introductions, incentive awards  dinners and for scattering loved ones' ashes.  About 60 percent of Star Fleet's business is repeat and referral. The recent  corporate party featuring the Mae West look-alike was the fifth the company  has chosen to have with Star Fleet.  Part of Lober's initial marketing problem - which continues today - is that  Houstonians just don't realize how close to the water they are.  "It's not like Fort Lauderdale, where water is part of the landscape," he  said. "In Houston, there's no high-visibility location to see the water, just  one spot on Loop 610 that overlooks the Port of Houston.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Archana Chaudhary  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    The Smart Investor Tertiary will be primary Indira Vergis  05/14/2001 Business Standard 2 Copyright (c) Business Standard  These are volatile times for world business. There are increasing jitters  that a slowing US economy could dampen prospects for the global economies.  Many developing regions, especially in Asia, are bracing themselves for a  bout of slightly lower growth.  But two countries, India and China which together account for about half the  region's gross domestic product (GDP_ will still continue to see their GDP  grow at six per cent, forecasts the Asian Development Bank. Many Indian economists agree with ADB's projections. In fact, they view the  prediction of a six per cent growth in India's GDP as benign. Nearly 54 per  cent of India's GDP is delivered by its services sector and a modest  performance by this sector, some economists say, will be enough to hold up  the GDP at six per cent. There are others who hope that better agricultural  performance could prompt the economy to hand in a better scorecard.  However, the Indian industry remains trapped in the doldrums, suffering from  a lack of consumer confidence and investments. Very few economists expect to  see signs of recovery sprouting any time soon.  An interest rate cut is considered vital by many to energise the sector. And,  they argue, there are certain economic indicators that encourage such a move.  Inflation is running at very low levels and the nation's foreign exchange  reserves are currently high enough to provide a strong defence to the Indian  currency. Surprisingly, our trade balance, which threatened to spiral out of  control by surging oil prices last year, has been contained. Since then, oil  prices have retreated and are expected to remain subdued. While a rate cut  may go some way in reviving sentiment and activity in the industrial sector,  stirring up consumer demand will still hinge on a normal monsoon.  Rain, rain, come again  For many economists, the prediction of India clinging to its current GDP  level is heavily contingent on a normal spell of monsoon this year.  "According to our assessment, we believe the Indian economy will grow by  around 6.5 per cent this fiscal year," says Chetan Ahya, vice president at J  M Morgan Stanley Securities.  In 2000-01, agricultural growth withered under a poor monsoon and a  subsequent drought in many parts of the country. For the second year in a  row, growth in the sector sank below one per cent. It stood at 0.9 per cent  compared with 0.7 per cent the previous year. While agriculture accounts for  only 24 per cent of GDP, it remains the most keenly-watched sector by  economists. "The performance of the agricultural sector is important because  of its linkages to the economy both on the supply side and on the consumption  side," says Mohan Nagarajan, chief economist at Credit Analysis and Research  Ltd (CARE). "It would lead to a better performance of agro-based industries,"  he adds.  More significantly, roughly 60 per cent of Indians still depend on  agriculture for their livelihood. "A good crop means that demand for  everything, from everyday use goods like toothpaste to larger items like  tractors will pick up," says Nagarajan. Economists are hoping that a good  monsoon will budge growth in the sector to around 1.5 to 2.5 per cent.  In service of the economy  Another key sector economists will be watching out for will be services.  India's services sector ranging from finance, insurance, hospitality to  transportation and communication slowed its pace in 2000-01. With growth  weakening by a whole per cent to 8.4 in 2000-01, sluggishness in this  important sector has been blamed for dragging down the overall GDP. Most  economists expect the sector to post either relatively flat growth or edge  slightly higher this year. But, it's performance will be vital to ensure that  overall GDP holds at six per cent. "Even if the agriculture and industry  numbers fall again but services sees even seven to eight per cent growth, it  will be enough to keep the GDP around six per cent," says Nagarajan.  Construction activity a services component that includes housing, roads and  other infrastructure projects demonstrated surprisingly good growth of 8.7  per cent and is expected to maintain the pace. Road construction is tipped to  show increasing levels of activity as work on the ambitious highway linking  Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Calcutta intensifies.  Chiming in will be the housing industry, benefiting in recent years from tax  reliefs and attractive financing schemes, and which have encouraged more  people to buy houses.  Another segment slated to witness good growth will be IT-enabled services,  says Morgan Stanley's Ahya. "We are emerging as the services workshop of the  world," he says. IT-enabled services like call centres and data processing,  though currently generating tiny revenues, are slated to turn into big money  spinners in the years ahead.  The telecommunications industry will also see improving levels of investment.  "The penetration of services is so low, that it has an intrinsic high growth  rate," says Ahya. For a taste of the market, consider this: out of the 100  Indians, only one uses the Internet and less than three own a telephone.  A good home show  And there could be a pleasant surprise in store for industry amid all the  gloom over its performance.  Adequate liquidity conditions are spurring expectations of a cut in interest  rates. Broad money(M3) a gauge of total money available in the economy  increased 16.2 per cent in 2000-01 against 14.6 per cent last year.  While the Reserve Bank of India had cut the bank rate in March, the belief is  that a further cut of 50 basis points is imminent. The bank rate the rate at  which the central bank lends to commercial banks currently stands at seven  per cent. Aiding the cause is the inflation data which shows the wholesale  price index at a tame 5.84 per cent. With economists betting that oil prices  will remain in the $24-28 a barrel range, inflation is not expected to  exhibit the oil price-inspired gyrations of last year. A cut could coax the  industry to step up activity, though admittedly, much would still depend on  rural demand.  Neighbours' envy  And while many Asian countries watch with increasing nervousness the impact  of an American downturn on their economies, India and China can afford to  remain relatively placid about global developments. That's because they are  less dependent on the US for their own economic health. That is expected to  shield them somewhat from being blown off-course like some other Asian  nations by the ill-wind of an American slump in demand.  With exports making up less than 10 per cent of India's GDP, its economy is  clearly not export-driven. In contrast, nearly 35 per cent of Indonesia's GDP  comes from exports, 57 per cent for Thailand, and 50 per cent for the  Philippines.  Yet, despite claiming only a small percentage of GDP, India's exports  remained a bright spot amid some gloomy economic data. Exports raced ahead 20  per cent to $44.1 billion in 2000-01. It was the second consecutive year of  good exports growth. On the flip side, imports rose, too, during the same  period to Rs $49.1 billion. But non-oil imports, however, declined 15 per  cent to $34.2 billion. That helped narrow the trade gap to $5.74 billion from  $12.79 billion the previous year.  Still, India can ill-afford to ignore completely the risks of an American  slump in demand. The US is India's largest trading partner and, in 2000-01, a  quarter of its exports headed to that nation. Besides, by taking in nearly 70  per cent of India's software exports, it is also India's most important  software exports destination.  Booming software exports accompanied by remittances by Indians living  overseas have been the primary factors exerting a calming influence on  India's balance of payments of position, especially in times of economic  turbulence. For example, last year, while a surging oil import bill  threatened to rattle the nation's trade gap, inflows from  invisibles(including income from software and Indians living abroad) came to  the rescue helping India limit its overall current account deficit.  It's a sobering realisation that has compelled the National Association of  Software and Service Companies(NASSCOM) to lower its exports forecast to  between $8.5 billion to $9 billion from its previous figure of $9.5 billion.  Earlier, it had also revised estimates for 2000-01 lower to $6.2 billion from  $6.3 billion. Still, observers say it isn't a cause for depression.

1939,"It is a decline in the growth rate and  not an actual downturn itself," points out John Band, chief executive  officer, ASK-Raymond James and Associates. And remittances look set to  maintain their pace as well. "Most remittances are still from Indians who  live in the Middle East, and I don't see any slowdown from this segment,"  says CARE's Nagarajan. Remittances totalled $9.8 billion in the nine months  to December 2000. Software exports brought in $4.6 billion during the same  period.  Foreign institutions support  Another recent 'feel-good' sign has been evident in the stock markets too.  Between January and April 2001, eigners poured in Rs 7,368 crore into India's  equity markets - a phenomenal 15 per cent more than what they invested in the  whole of calendar 2000.  Yet, experts aren't reading too much into it. In the past few months,  investors have been fleeing from a shower of profit warnings in the US and  seeking cover in alternative investments. As they rejuggle their portfolios,  some money will inevitably flow into India and other countries, experts say.

"They were slightly hiding behind the fact that the SEC has got this inquiry going. The fact that two days later Andy is gone, and he was in the center, is a good sign that the company is realizing just how concerned investors are."       "There's always that worry once the SEC gets involved that it could extend. You never know what could come of that."       "There is a bit of fear of the unknown about Enron now, with the SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset write-downs."       "Another thing they're criticized for is their lack of disclosure. We still haven't seen a balance sheet for the third quarter."       "People are saying, why don't you include a balance sheet with your results? They promised better disclosure in the past and that was meant to begin in the third quarter."       "You'd like to see just more information on asset write- downs and a discussion of their off-balance-sheet financing -- all these vehicles they have like Marlin and Osprey."       "We'd like to see some clarity, answering those sort of questions."       "It seems as though Enron at least are maybe at the start of a process where they're going to address and clean up their balance sheet and they've started to replace management."       "Investors have already had enough issues" in corporate bonds recently and "sometimes investors just think, 'Not another nasty in my portfolio,' and I'd rather exit."       "For certain investors maybe they just get scared. I wanted to know more about it. People had speculated if it could go to junk. I don't think they could because I don't think Enron could exist as a junk company."       "There's a certain reluctance" to sell the bonds.

A coal broker said counterparties were watching Enron's credit and limiting longer-term business with the company.  "Everyone is nervous," a buyer at a Midwestern utility said.  Major coal producers and coal-burning utilities interviewed by Dow Jones Newswires on Wednesday said they hadn't suspended trading with Enron.  Physical prices were largely unaffected by the turmoil in the trading business and continued the downward trend that began in mid-October.  In the East, where prices softened in light trade, Central Appalachian barge deals for November delivery to the Big Sandy River were done in late October as low as $30.75 free on board, down from $33.50 a ton.

No deals were confirmed.  In the West, Powder River Basin coal with a heat rate of 8,800 British thermal units slipped to $7.55 a ton for November, down a nickel since late October. Deals for calendar year 2002 were done at $8.10 and $8.15 a ton, down about 10 cents.  PRB 8,400 Btu coal traded very little, sources said. November deliveries deals were done at $5.90 a ton, down from $6.25 a ton at the end of October. Calendar year 2002 was pegged between $6.35 and $6.45 a ton, down 10 cents.  According to the Energy Information Agency, total U.S. coal production through Oct. 27, the latest date for which figures were available, ticked upward by 445,000 short tons to 21.8 million tons.  Appalachian coal production, year to date, was 2% ahead of last year. Total Appalachian production in 2001 is 356,557 tons, up from 349,711 tons in the same period last year.  U.S. Western coal production year to date remains steady at 6.4% ahead of 2000 figures. EIA reports total western coal production through Oct. 27 at 447,308 tons, up from 420,353 tons in the year-earlier period.  Railcar loadings through the end of October were 5% higher than comparable 2000 figures, according the EIA.

LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - U.S. energy trading giant Enron Corp. , whose shares have tumbled amid a regulatory probe and doubts about its ability to raise cash, may lose or offload its metals business, senior industry sources said on Thursday.  In the wings are several interested parties looking to snap up the company's metals customer base. "There are people out there with the experience and the contacts who see this time as a good opportunity to get into the market," a senior metals market source told Reuters on Thursday.  Such a move for Enron's metals portfolio would involve the acquisition of an existing organisation as a vehicle, the source added.  "We do not comment on rumours," an Enron spokeswoman said, declining further comment.  Other Enron Metals assets were also said to be in play, including the Henry Bath warehousing company, which operates LME-registered warehouses in the UK, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United States.  MAJOR PLAYER  Houston-based Enron became a major player in the metals trade in May last year when it acquired MG plc, a leading independent international metals dealing firm in London, in a deal worth around 300 million pounds.  The company is a ring-dealing member of the London Metal Exchange (LME), able to participate in open-outcry floor trade, and is active in screen-based metals trade via its EnronOnline platform (www.enrononline.com).  The company no longer has a stake in online metals trading platform EMETRA (www.emetra.com), having sold its holding to other EMETRA shareholders this summer.  But while Enron may be a heavy hitter in the metals sector, base metals trading could hardly be regarded as one of its core businesses.  The company's third-quarter 2001 results statement shows income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) from "Europe and other commodity markets" - which includes metals and steel alongside European gas and power, among others - of $53 million, unchanged from the year-earlier period.  This compares with IBIT from Enron's gas and power market-making operations and merchant energy activities in North and South America of $710 million over the same period.  But the third-quarter figure that has slashed the value of the company's shares is a $1.2 billion write-down of shareholder equity related to off-balance sheet transactions.  On Thursday the company said it would restate its earnings for 1997 to 2001 to reflect the transactions - a move which wipes $613 million of the company's reported net income from 1997 through the first half of this year.  The company's stock has dropped by almost 78 percent since Enron released its earnings results on October 16, falling to nine-year lows amid concerns about the company's ability to raise cash.  The story added an extra twist on Wednesday as news broke that U.S.-based energy trading and marketing firm Dynegy Inc. was in talks to buy out Enron.  Against this background speculation is rife about the future of the metals operation, fuelled by the company's decision last month to trim between 10 and 20 percent of its metals workforce as part of a wider staff reduction by Enron Europe.  UNLIKELY TO REMAIN INTACT  Any decision by Enron or a possible future purchaser to offload its metals operations would be unlikely to see Enron Metals remain intact, traders said.  "They paid $450 million for MG.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

5709,"I don't think so," said one.  "Why buy the whole concern when you can cherry-pick the best traders and the clients will follow?" added another.  An increasing emphasis on screen trading at the expense of personal contacts may already have persuaded some Enron clients to jump ship.  "We've picked up a fair amount of small and mid-sized trade-type business in Europe from people who've said 'I'm not going to be told just to trade on a screen,'" said one trader.

5711,"Customers still want to talk to their broker, and are willing to pay commission for the service," the senior source said.

5713,""  Enron's trade counterparties are also keeping a close eye on the company's financial situation, said a trader at one LME brokerage.  "People aren't particularly concerned about short-term trading (with Enron), but when it comes to OTC business done outside the clearing market they're backing off a bit," he said.

WRAP: Enron To Restate Results; Confirms Dynegy Talks  11/08/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) said it will restate its financial results from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001, as the embattled energy company and Dynegy Inc. both confirmed they are in talks on a possible business combination.  In a filing Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Enron said its financial and audit reports are unreliable for those periods. Enron said that three "unconsolidated entities should have been included in its consolidated financial statements," based on generally accepted accounting principles. These entities are Chewco Investments LP, Joint Energy Development Investments LP and a wholly owned unit of LJM Cayman LP.  Enron said it has established a special committee to review all transactions. The committee will specifically review all "economic results" related to transactions between Enron and LJM.  Last month Enron took a $1.01 billion charge in the third quarter related to write-downs of investments. Of this, $35 million was attributed to partnerships run until recently by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who has since been replaced. Enron also disclosed it shrank shareholder equity by $1.2 billion, as a result of several transactions including ones undertaken with Fastow's investment vehicle.  Later, Enron said the SEC would investigate the company's "related party transactions," including those with the Fastow partnerships.  The restatement will reflect the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholders' equity, as well as various income-statement and balance-sheet adjustments determined by Enron and its auditors.  "We believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about these matters," said Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay  Over the past couple of days, Enron has been scrambling to line up quick financing from a prominent outside investor and has been in discussions with private-equity firms and power-trading companies.  Earlier, The Wall Street Journal reported that Dynegy was trying to buy Enron for $7 billion to $8 billion in stock. Both are Houston-based energy-trading and power companies.  Because any combination of the two would likely be scrutinized for many months, and Enron needs to shore up its finances now, Dynegy reportedly is expected to inject $1.5 billion into Enron immediately, people familiar with the matter said.  ChevronTexaco Corp. (CVX), which owns a 26% stake in Dynegy, is expected to provide Dynegy with the funds for the cash infusion and is playing a significant role in the negotiations, the Journal said.  The boards of Dynegy, Chevron and Enron reportedly met Wednesday to discuss a potential deal. Enron's stock has plunged since Oct. 16, when the company posted a $618 million third-quarter loss and revealed that its shareholder equity had been reduced.  The talks between Enron and Dynegy follow a sharp decline in Enron's stock over the past several weeks.    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. , the embattled energy trader, said on Thursday fired its treasurer and a counsel who the company said were part-owners of one of its off-balance sheet partnerships now under investigation by U.S. regulators.  Enron said it was terminating the employment of Ben Glisan, managing director and treasurer of Enron Corp., and Kristina Mordaunt, a managing director and counsel of an Enron division. Enron said it believes that these two employees, along with four other former Enron employees, were involved as partners in a limited partnership called the LJM1 that had dealings with Enron.

Enron restates net income for periods from 1997 to Q3 2001  11/08/2001 AFX News (c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd HOUSTON (AFX) - Enron Corp announced it is restating its net results for 1997 to 2000 and for the first three quarters of 2001 to take account of various related party and off-balance sheet transactions in which the company was involved.  The restatement have no effect on Enron's current financial position, it said. In its restated figures, Enron posted reductions to net income of 96 mln usd in 1997, 113 mln usd in 1998, 250 mln in 1999 and 132 mln in 2000, as well as increases of 17 mln usd for the first quarter of 2001 and 5 mln for the second, but reduced the third quarter figure by 17 mln usd.  The restatement will have no negative impact on the company's reported earnings for the nine month period ending Sept 2001, however, it said.  The company said its changes to net income are the result of the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments LP and Chewco Investments LP beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of the LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  The JEDI and Chewco consolidations will increase Enron's debt by about 711 mln usd in 1997, 561 mln in 1998, 685 mln in 1999 and 628 mln in 2000, the company said.  kgd/jkm/ For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved. NEW YORK (AP) - Beleaguered energy trading giant Enron Corp. announced Thursday it would restate its earnings since 1997, in part to reflect a controversial dlrs 1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that has sparked a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.  Enron, whose stock price has fallen roughly 80 percent in the past three weeks, also said it was holding talks with Dynegy Inc. relating to some form of business transaction. The New York Times reported that Dynegy was considering buying Enron, its larger hometown rival for dlrs 8 billion. In a filing with the SEC, Enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 "should not be relied upon" and that partnerships run by Enron officials during that period should have been consolidated into the financial results of the Houston-based energy trading giant.  These partnerships are Chewco Investments L.P., Joint Energy Development Investments L.P., and a wholly owned unit of LJM Cayman L.P.  "We believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about these matters," said Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive.  By its own assessment, Enron's restatement reduces previously reported net income by roughly dlrs 586 million and increases its debt by dlrs 2.59 billion. The change reflects the financial impact of retroactively consolidating the partnerships.  The company also fired two executives on Thursday: Ben Glisan, its treasurer, and Kristina Mordaunt, general counsel for one of its divisions. Previously, Enron had ousted chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who was in charge of some of the partnerships.  Shares of Enron were off 10 cents to dlrs 8.95 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Enron said it believes the restatement will include a reduction to net income of about dlrs 96 million in 1997, dlrs 113 million in 1998, dlrs 250 million in 1999 and dlrs 132 million in 2000, increases of dlrs 17 million for the first quarter of 2001 and dlrs 5 million for the second quarter and a reduction of dlrs 17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  Enron, the top buyer and seller of natural gas and the top wholesale marketer in the United States, had become one of the nation's 10 largest companies, recording revenue of dlrs 100.8 billion in 2000.  But the company has been beset by huge investment losses and questions about its financial stability. In particular, its stock has plunged since Oct. 16, when the company posted a dlrs 618 million third quarter loss and revealed that its shareholder equity had been reduced.  Enron's woes have prompted considerable speculation about a possible takeover of the company.  Besides Dynegy, companies mentioned as possible suitors included General Electric's GE Capital unit and Royal Dutch/Shell Group.  On Thursday, both Dynegy and Enron released statements confirming they were in talks, but declined to provide any details.  The New York Times reported earlier that Dynegy is considering paying about dlrs 8 billion in stock, or roughly dlrs 10 per share.  Under the terms of the deal, Enron would receive an immediate dlrs 1.5 billion cash infusion from oil giant Chevron Texaco, which holds a 27 percent stake in Dynegy, the Times said, citing executives close to the discusssion.  Chevron Texaco would provide an additional dlrs 1 billion injection at a later date, the Times reported, while Dynegy would assume dlrs 12.8 billion in Enron debt, plus billions of dollars in other debt that has been kept off the beleaguered company's balance sheet and has been a significant contributor to its current problems.

HOUSTON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. said on Thursday it provided U.S. regulators with more information about off-balance sheet deals, and other transactions that led to a shattering of the company's credibility and to an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Enron, the once high-flying Houston-based energy trading company, also confirmed it was in talks with its hometown rival Dynegy Inc. over a possible business combination. Terms of any deal have not been agreed on, the two companies said. Enron said that it will restate its earnings from 1997 to 2000 and the first two quarters of 2001 as the company addresses concerns raised by the SEC and shareholders.  Shares of Enron dropped 20 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $8.85 in Thursday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Enron, the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in North America, said the required restatement reflects the surprising - and controversial - $1.2 billion reduction to shareholders' equity the company recently disclosed.  The restatement also reflects adjustments to the company's income statement and balance sheet, now that Enron has decided that the financial activities of Chewco Investments, L.P., Joint Energy Development Investments Limited Partnership (JEDI) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of LJM1 should indeed have been included in the company's consolidated financial statements.  As a result of the restatement, Enron is reducing its 1997 net income by about $96 million, 1998 net income by $113 million, 1999 net income by $250 million and 2000 net income by $132 million.  It is also restating first quarter 2001 results with a $17 million net income increase, second quarter 2001 results with a $5 million increase and third quarter 2001 results with a $17 million net income decrease.  Consolidating Chewco and JEDI also increases Enron's debt by about $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.  "We believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about these matters," said Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay in a statement.

Bailout Seen Unlikely By Jason Leopold  11/08/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  (This story initially ran late Wednesday.) LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Maybe Enron Corp. (ENE) is just too big to fail. Maybe not.  Is the embattled energy trading company important enough to qualify for a federal bailout?  Not likely, according to a number of analysts who believe that there are enough big energy companies in the U.S. to keep markets liquid if Enron goes under.  For that reason, a federal bailout is probably not in the cards, even though Enron controls about 25% of U.S. natural gas and electricity markets, they added.  "A bailout would only occur if needed to maintain liquidity in the energy markets in order to avoid potential for skyrocketing prices and avoid reliability risks," said Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER) analyst Steven Fleishman. "In the end, government is most interested in keeping the lights and the heat on at a reasonable price.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
5714,""  Once a Wall Street darling, Enron's stock has fallen about by 75% in a mere three weeks, and the company is now the subject of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.  Because it's so big, energy companies have watched Enron's troubles closely, and speculated about what they could mean for energy markets overall. A number have said they've started to cut back on their exposure to the company.  Enron's stock has been falling all year, but it plunged several weeks ago after it disclosed a $1.2 billion writedown of shareholder equity. The SEC subsequently launched an investigation into Enron partnerships associated with the writedown.  Enron spokesperson Karen Denne said the company wouldn't speculate on the idea of a bailout.  "First of all I can't speculate, and second of all we're not even going to entertain worst case scenarios," Denne said. "As far as I know no one has approached Washington about a federal bailout.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

5716,""  A bailout would require federal legislation.  To qualify, Enron would have to argue that a bailout is an economic necessity, according to Christine Uspenski, an analyst at Schwab Capital Markets (SCH). Quite Different Cup Of Tea From Chrysler   Unlike the situation that led to a $1.2 billion federal bailout of Chrysler Corp. in 1980, hundreds of thousands of jobs aren't now at risk. Enron is nowhere near the size of Chrysler.  "When Chrysler was bailed out there were senators and congressman who were going to have unemployed constituents so they proposed federal legislation to give the company a $1.2 billion loan," Uspenski said. "A bailout would need federal legislation proposed by Texas delegation.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

5722,""  A merger, on the other hand, would funnel billions of dollars into Enron, keep the company afloat and might help the company's stock recover, analysts said.  On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Enron is in talks for a capital infusion and possible acquisition by Dynegy Inc. (DYN). Also, Enron said Thursday it will restate its financial statements from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001, saying its financial and audit reports are unreliable for all those periods. The company fired its treasurer and general counsel.  Andrew Meade, an analyst with Commerzbank in New York, said a bailout would likely never materialize because there are other large traders of energy commodities in the marketplace, such as Duke Energy (DUK), Dynegy, Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Williams Cos. (WMB), that can provide liquidity to the market.  A merger would be a better route for the company, but would pose its own set of problems, Meade added.  "With a merger or an equity infusion, Enron can certainly survive," Meade said.

5724,""  Enron's best assets "get up and go home everyday," Meade said, referring to energy traders at the company. If Enron were to get into a friendly merger or buyout, he added, the company should lock in its top 50 or 100 traders with non-compete clauses. It would be much easier for Dynegy or other Houston energy companies to simply hire Enron employees rather than buy the company.  Other analysts also pointed to risks in a merger with Enron.  "A merger is certainly an option, but it gives you pause if it asks you to be the white knight," Uspenski said. A proposed merger could turn out to be a "minefield and there would certainly be a pretty sizable exposure.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Enron Bonds Give Back Gains as Firm Restates Profit (Update3) 2001-11-08 16:40 (New York)  Enron Bonds Give Back Gains as Firm Restates Profit (Update3)       (Updates bond and stock prices.)       New York, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds pared earlier gains as the biggest energy trader said it restated earnings for more than four years, increasing concern that Dynegy Inc. won't buy out the company.       Enron's 7.88 percent coupon notes due in 2003 traded at 77 cents on the dollar to yield 27 percent, down from a bid of 82 cents this morning, traders said. The debt, which was trading near 100 last month, was bid at 77 cents yesterday. Enron shares, down 75 percent in the last month, fell 64 cents to $8.41 today.       Dynegy said today it's in talks to acquire Enron in what people familiar with the situation said would likely be a stock transaction worth $8 billion. An acquisition would bolster Enron's credit rating, which was recently lowered, traders said.       "Enron bonds justifiably rallied on the good news of Dynegy. They naturally settled back down as the market assesses the significance of the restatement," said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst at CreditSights Inc. "The whole problem goes away and sighs of relief all around if they come to terms with Dynegy."       Enron's 6.4 percent notes due in 2006 were bid at around 70 cents, down from this morning when the debt traded at 84 cents. Yesterday, the notes were priced between 72 cents and 74 cents.       The difference between bid and ask prices for Enron debt widened to about 4 cents to 5 cents -- "monster" spreads, Reynolds said -- from 2 cents this morning, indicating few investors are willing to buy or sell the bonds without more news.       While Moody's Investors Service rates Enron's credit as "Baa2", one rung higher than its "Baa3" grade for Dynegy, other ratings companies including Standard & Poor's and Fitch Inc. have assigned Dynegy a higher rating. Also, Enron's ratings have been cut in recent weeks and face further reduction, while Dynegy's credit outlook is stable.       Enron bonds and shares have tumbled in recent weeks on concern about partnerships run by the company's former chief financial officer and concerns the company's trading business will be hurt by the credit downgrades. Enron and Dynegy are both based in Houston.       Enron has $15.8 billion of bonds outstanding, more than double the $6.8 billion market value of its stock, according to Bloomberg data.

Gas on the New York Mercantile Exchange reached $10.10 per million British thermal units in late December and touched $1.76 per million British thermal units in September.       The market for gas derivatives is 15 times the cash market for delivery to customers, and broad price changes make it difficult for oil and gas companies to set budgets, Plank said.

Houston, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which today reduced its earnings for the last four years by $552 million because of accounting errors involving affiliates, also said it fired its treasurer and a corporate attorney for making improper investments in one of the affiliates.       Enron fired Treasurer Ben Glisan and Kristina Mordaunt, the general counsel of an unspecified Enron division. The two invested in an affiliate created by Enron to buy and sell the company's assets, the Houston-based company said in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.       The transactions also involved two former Enron employees and former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who was replaced two weeks ago, the filing said. The former employees were Kathy Lynn, vice president of an unnamed Enron division, and Anne Yaeger, identified by Enron as a non-officer employee.       Lea Fastow, Andrew Fastow's wife, referred all questions to her husband's attorney, who couldn't immediately be reached for comment. Glisan wouldn't comment. Attempts to reach Mordaunt weren't successful.                          $30 Million Profit       Fastow made more than $30 million by managing and investing in two private limited partnerships called LJM Cayman LP, known as LJM1, and LJM2 Co-Investment LP. Enron said on Oct. 24 that Fastow had been replaced as CFO and put on leave. The filing said he is no longer with the company.       Enron said it believes Lynn and Yaeger remain associated with LJM2.       The SEC began a formal investigation into some of Enron's partnerships last month, causing the stock price to plummet from already low levels. Shares of Enron had fallen 89 percent this year, as of the close of trading yesterday.       Enron, short on cash, began merger talks with Dynegy Inc. Yesterday, it failed to reach an agreement with Dynegy to sell itself for about $8 billion in stock. ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 27 percent of Dynegy, is also involved in the talks. Dynegy is concerned credit rating companies may downgrade Enron's debt, people familiar with the situation said.       Enron shares fell 64 cents, or 7.1 percent, $8.41. Shares of Dynegy, which is also based in Houston, rose $3.50, or 11 percent, to $36.50. ChevronTexaco rose 31 cents to $87.59.                              Restatement       Enron restated its earnings for the past four years and the first three quarters of 2001 to incorporate the first LJM partnership, as well as Chewco Investments LP and Joint Energy Development Investments LP, known as JEDI.       Enron calls them special purpose entities, or SPEs. They are vehicles for getting access to capital or hedging risk that can be moved off the books under some circumstances. Enron established more than 30 SPEs.       The company reported that Enron and "Enron-related entities" participated in 24 "business relationships" in which LJM1 or LJM2 participated. They included the sale of asset such as unused fiber optic cable, the purchase of debt or equity interests in Enron affiliates, and the sale by LJM2 of a call and a put option on some assets.      In addition to Chewco and JEDI, a wholly owned subsidiary of LMJ1 that "engaged in derivative transactions with Enron to permit Enron to hedge market risks of an equity investment in Rhythms NetConnections, Inc.," which provides high-speed networking to businesses.       Enron said in the SEC filing that those hedging transactions should have been consolidated into its 1999 and 2000 results because the LJM1 subsidiary was inadequately capitalized. Enron did not specify why transactions by Chewco and JEDI should have been included on its balance sheet.       Enron said it believes that Michael J. Kopper, a former company employee, managed a Chewco general partner and invested in it. The company said it also believes that Kopper was the controlling partner of a limited partnership that (through another limited partnership) in March 2000 purchased interests in affiliated subsidiaries of LJM1."

6311,""  Because customer surveys indicate that about 20 percent of Star Fleet's  business comes from being seen on the water, Lober and his captains make  their crafts as visible as possible whenever they take them out. The real  opportunity for hot-dogging comes when a customer charters two or three  boats, and they raft up to become the Star Fleet flotilla, with customers  moving from one boat to another. A three-boat charter can handle up to 375  guests. But one boat can still do a lot of advertising. At the recent corporate party, Mae West joined the other revelers who were  slinging Mardi Gras beads at al fresco diners as Capt. Tony DeFore edged Star  Gazer close to the Kemah waterfront. They may not have known it, but they  were doing a little of Lober's public relations work for him. As the boat pulled back into the Star Fleet Marina, Lober pointed out a barge  under construction. When it is finished - by the end of the year, he hopes -  the bottom floor will be a galley for food preparation, the second the Star  Fleet office and the third floor an 1,800-square-foot apartment. It will kind of resemble that three-tiered wooden box he brought home from  school years ago, Lober says. And he's going to live at the top. Photos: 1-2.

More power to reform agenda Soma Banerjee  05/13/2001 The Economic Times Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)  THE electricity industry is often identified as the black sheep in the  infrastructure sector which has continued to lag behind despite an overdose  of government support. Despite being one of the earlier industries to be opened up, private  investments in this sector have failed to take off. Worse, the only sizeable project which was something to write home about  Enrons Dabhol Power plant in Maharashtra is currently a under cloud with its  promoters involved in a legal battle with the state entity and its sole  consumer for non-payment of bills. Policy makers and investors in the energy  sector are still groping to find ways and means to improve the performance of  this key industry. Although private investments were expected to come in a big way in creating  new capacities, policy uncertainties and above all the poor financial health  of the consumer, in most cases the SEBs, have posed major problems for power  plant developers. After about ten years of liberalisation, the private sector has to its credit  only about 5000 MW and according to projections by experts investments in  greenfield projects are unlikely before four to five years. The factors that have been taken into consideration in the current projection  are almost inbuilt into the system. For one, there is a general agreement  that stressing on generation alone without doing much on the distribution  front has eroded the financial health of most SEBs."Private power developers cannot be expected to invest in projects till they  are assured that they will be paid for the energy produced, experts say.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

According to estimates drawn up by financial institutions like Power Finance  Corporation an organisation responsible for monitoring the financial health  of the SEBs and helping them with their reform programmes almost all the SEBs  have registered a negative turnover. Which is why the financing or  escrowability of SEBs across the country has been reduced to zero. According to Union power minister Suresh Prabhu, the states are now  responsive to changes and reforms and the recent drive initiated by the  Centre to work with the state governments was expected to yield results. But this sector has seen far too many committees which have failed to yield  much hope and it is only sheer determination of SEBs and political will that  can help this backbencher.

India Power Min: New Power Deal With Enron Unit Possible By Himendra Kumar Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  05/12/2001 Dow Jones International News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India is hopeful the Maharashtra State Electricity  Board's power purchase agreement with the U.S. energy company Enron Corp.'s  (ENE) Indian unit Dabhol Power Co. can be renegotiated and the DPC's dispute  over payments be settled, the country's federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu  said. In a weekend interview with Dow Jones Newswires, Prabhu said the very fact  that the DPC had come to the negotiating table for discussions on its power  price was an indication that Enron was keen to save its India project. A special panel, set up by the Maharashtra state government, met with  representatives of the DPC, for the first time Friday and agreed to another  meeting May 23. Friday's meeting lasted for more than two hours."I am of the view that a negotiated settlement is possible since the first  meeting of DPC with the Maharahtra state expert panel went off well.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

6319,""  The Maharashtra state government contends that the price paid for electricity  from the Dabhol power plant, India's biggest-ever foreign investment at $2.9  billion, is "unaffordable" and seeks to renegotiate tariffs. A recent committee appointed by the government, the Godbole panel,  recommended that the power purchase agreement be renegotiated. Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. Critics object to Dabhol charging 7.1 rupees ($1=INR46.8825) a kilowatt-hour  for its power, compared with INR1.5/kwh charged by other suppliers. The 2,184-megawatt DPC project in Maharashtra has been mired in financial  disputes after the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its main customer,  failed to pay the December 2000 and January bills. The Godbole panel is  working toward lowering the DPC's power tariff and allowing the sale of  excess power to the federal government or its utilities. A restructuring of  the DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda. The Maharashtra government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a  revised agreement within a month. The DPC currently operates a 740-megawatt  naphtha plant contributing about 0.7% to India's installed capacity. Enron  has maintained that work will be completed by the year-end in the second  phase of the Dabhol project that will add 1,444 MW to its capacity. The plant  will switch from naphtha to liquefied natural gas as a fuel source in 2002. Texas-based Enron has a 65% stake in the DPC and is the project's largest  shareholder. Other shareholders include the MSEB with 15%, and General  Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel Enterprises (X.BTL) with 10% each.-By Himendra Kumar, Dow Jones Newswires; 91-11-461-9427;  himendra.kumar@dowjones.com  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

OFFICIALS of Enron India today met the expert committee  headed by Dr Madhav Godbole to discuss the fate of Enron's Dabhol Power  Company. Mr A.V. Gokak, Union Government representative, who was appointed only last  night, could not attend the meeting due to the short notice. Lenders to the project who were to attend the meeting stayed away. Instead, Mr A.G. Karkhanis, former Executive Director, Industrial Development  Bank of India, attended as observer on behalf of foreign and Indian lenders,  Mr Vinay Mohan Lal, Energy Secretary, told reporters here after the meeting.

6320,"What does that mean?"  Though none of those present at the meeting was willing to give more details,  senior State Government officials had earlier told Business Line that the  State would be willing to discuss phase II only after a decision on the  rebate slapped on DPC."Basically our strategy will be to bring the Rs 401- crore rebate payable by  DPC to the centre-stage," the official said."The company has not mentioned a  single word about the rebate in any of their letters to either the MSEB or  the State.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
6321,"And we, on the other hand, have discussed anything but the rebate  in our letters to DPC," he said. Mr Wade Cline, Managing Director, Enron India, did not comment on whether the  company would issue the preliminary termination notice. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, and  Mr Lal had last evening briefed the Democratic Front constituents about their  stand vis-a-vis Enron. They are understood to have told the political brass of the State that MSEB  does not need the second phase of the Dabhol power project. They categorically said MSEB would not buy power from DPC-phase II, it is  learnt. MSEB also reiterated its stand that DPC should adjust the dues owed by it  against the non-performance penalty. Senior MSEB officials said the board had replied to the arbitration notice  issued by DPC and made its position clear. The board is of the opinion that  DPC should adjust Rs 213 crore - the December and January bills - against the  Rs 401 crore penalty for performance default. The State Government also has backed the MSEB in its replies to the three  arbitration notices served on it. It has said that since MSEB does not accept  the charges - non-compliance with the power purchase agreement (PPA) -  leveled against it, the State is not bound to pay. The Centre too is understood to have backed MSEB in its preliminary reply to  the conciliation notice from DPC.Today's meeting was attended by Mr Cline, Mr Neil McGregor, President, DPC,  Mr Mukesh Tyagi, Vice-President, DPC, and Mr Sanjeev Khandekar, VP, DPC, and  Mr Mohan Gurunath, Chief Financial Officer, DPC.Among the renegotiation panel members, Mr Deepak Parekh, Mr E A S Sarma and  Mr Kirit Parikh were also unable to attend. The next meeting is scheduled on  May 23, Mr Lal said. Gokak nominated to panel: The Government has nominated former fertiliser and  telecom secretary, Mr A.V. Gokak, to the arbitration committee involving  Dabhol Power Company (DPC).The Power Ministry had earlier mooted the additional solicitor general, Mr  Harish Salve's candidature for the job. The conciliation process, however, has been hanging fire as the third  conciliator is yet to be appointed. Dabhol Power Company had written to the  Centre last month seeking six names for selection of a mutually acceptable  conciliator to kick- start the conciliation process. DPC's letter to the Finance Ministry was seen in the context of the  substantial delay between the initiation of the conciliation process three  weeks ago and the finalisation of the conciliators. Soon after the  conciliation process was initiated, DPC decided to invoke political force  majeure and moved in for arbitration - a prelude to termination of the  project. Our Bureau  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. India to allow 3rd party sale if DPC, MSEB jointly approach  05/12/2001 Press Trust of India Limited (c) 2001 PTI Ltd. Mumbai, May 12 (PTI) The Federal Government will allow sale of power to a  "willing buyer" if the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) and  Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) will together approach the power  ministry with a concrete proposal for their 2,184 mw project in Dabhol."I will give whatever status they want, including a mega project one, if DPC  and MSEB jointly approach the Centre (Federal Government) for the same",  Indian Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told reporters here Saturday. He said the Indian Government would extend its cooperation to the Maharashtra  government (western state) "in every way" to resolve the imbroglio between  MSEB and DPC.When pointed out that both the state government and DPC were of the opinion  that federal power utility National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) should  buy the power, Prabhu said NTPC cannot do so as it was power selling entity  and not buying one."There is no question of NTPC buying power from the project since long term  power purchase agreements (PPAs) have been signed by NTPC with the buying  states", he reiterated. Prabhu said the Indian Government would also try and find out potential  buyers of DPC power "if other states were willing to buy the same".Earlier in his meeting with state chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the  latter had suggested that NTPC sell the excess power over and above the  300-400 MW needed for the state from the 740 MW phase-I and soon to be  commissioned phase-II of 1,444 MW, to other needy states.(THROUGH ASIA PULSE) 12-05 2001  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

LOCAL STORIES DEFAZIO CALLS FOR STATE TO BUY PGE TO PROTECT RATES DAVE HOGAN AND JEFF MAPES of the Oregonian Staff  05/12/2001 Portland Oregonian SUNRISE C01 (Copyright (c) The Oregonian 2001)  Summary: The suggestion generates little enthusiasm and critics suspect it's  motivated by the lawmaker's possible race for governor  "I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can  insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business  community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale  markets.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
6322,"" -- U.S. REP. PETER DeFAZIO D-ORE.The state of Oregon should consider buying investor-owned Portland General  Electric to help protect Oregonians from gyrations in the electricity market,  U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio declared Friday. Gov. John Kitzhaber reacted politely and said he'll explore the idea, but  others said it's a long shot because of political, financial and timing  factors. Critics said the proposal appeared aimed more at attracting attention to  DeFazio's potential candidacy for governor than anything else. Several companies already are considering buying the utility, but DeFazio  said state ownership could help keep PGE customers' electricity rates low and  generate profits that could help the rest of Oregon."I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can  insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business  community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale  markets," said DeFazio, D-Ore. PGE serves about 725,000 retail customers, mostly in the Portland area, and  is owned by Houston-based Enron Corp. PGE's sale to Nevada's Sierra Pacific  Resources for $3.1 billion officially fell apart last month. Other possible  buyers include Northwest Natural and ScottishPower, which owns PacifiCorp. While Enron and PGE officials declined to comment Friday, legislative leaders  showed no particular enthusiasm for DeFazio's idea."I appreciate his efforts, but I don't think it's the right idea at this  time," said House Speaker Mark Simmons, R-Elgin. He said the state already  has a package of bills aimed at spurring more energy production and  conservation. Senate President Gene Derfler, R-Salem, said he'd be willing to sit down and  talk with DeFazio."I would not just shut the door," he said, but he doesn't  plan to devote much work to the proposal. Derfler questioned whether state  government could run a utility as efficiently as a business. DeFazio said a PGE purchase would offer several benefits. State ownership  would put control of PGE in local hands instead of those of a faraway  corporation such as ScottishPower. For PGE customers, state ownership would  provide some protection and stability in electricity rates. It also would be  a good investment that would pay for itself and perhaps pump revenue back  into the state's coffers. The purchase could be financed with tax-exempt bonds sold by the state. DeFazio said state Treasurer Randall Edwards had told him the idea was "in  the realm of possibility.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
6323,""  DeFazio's idea is an intriguing one and could provide some benefits, said Bob  Jenks, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board, which represents  customers of investor-owned utilities such as PGE.Jenks said the primary benefit would be that, if the state bought PGE, the  utility would be able to buy lower-priced electricity from the Bonneville  Power Administration, which is required to sell power at lower rates to  publicly owned utilities. However, a publicly owned PGE wouldn't be able to  buy the lower-priced BPA power for about five years because of electricity  sales contracts that already are in place. And even if PGE were able to buy lower-priced BPA power, that wouldn't  necessarily translate to lower electricity bills for PGE customers, Jenks  said. In addition, he said it could increase rates for other publicly owned  utilities because the BPA has a shortage of cheap hydropower. The state Public Utility Commission would have to approve any sale of PGE,  but outgoing PUC Chairman Ron Eachus criticized DeFazio's proposal, saying it  had the potential to increase rates both for PGE customers and for publicly  owned utilities. He also said it seemed designed to get political attention  for DeFazio's potential candidacy."I think we're in the political season where people are proposing grandiose  schemes that aren't very well thought out, and this seems to be one of  those," Eachus said. DeFazio conceded that a high-profile proposal focused on a Portland-area  issue such as the ownership of PGE would be a good way for a candidate to  build support for a run for governor, but he said that had nothing to do with  his plan.

BEGGS Associated Press Writer  05/11/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. SALEM, Ore. (AP) - Congressman Peter DeFazio on Friday proposed that the  state buy Portland General Electric as a way to hold down power costs. The Democrat outlined his plan after presenting it to Gov. John Kitzhaber,  who said he would ask his energy advisers to analyze it. PGE is Oregon's biggest electric utility, serving more than 700,000  customers. DeFazio said a state purchase of the company could insulate many  Oregonians from "the craziness in power markets.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
6324,""  DeFazio said the state could buy the company by issuing revenue bonds and  have the utility operate as a public power entity. He said the purchase would give the state a diverse mix of transmission  rights along with hydropower, gas, coal and renewable energy sources."While I have not exhaustively researched the proposal, it does appear to be  feasible," said DeFazio, an opponent of electric deregulation. Enron Corp., the Texas-based owner of PGE, is trying to sell the utility. Sierra Pacific last month abandoned its plan to buy PGE for $3.1 billion,  citing increasing difficulties in the current market and the political  environment in the West. Kitzhaber said he's not opposed to the idea of the state buying a private  utility, as long as it would benefit consumers. DeFazio said PGE has been a profitable company, and putting it in public  ownership could give it preference over private utilities for the Bonneville  Power Administration's hydropower. The congressman's suggestion wasn't welcomed by the Legislature."Thanks, but no thanks," said House Speaker Mark Simmons."Philosophically, I think it's the wrong approach," he said."We have a  bipartisan package of bills dealing with the issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"They were slightly hiding behind the fact that the SEC has got this inquiry going. The fact that two days later Andy is gone, and he was in the center, is a good sign that the company is realizing just how concerned investors are."       "There's always that worry once the SEC gets involved that it could extend. You never know what could come of that."       "There is a bit of fear of the unknown about Enron now, with the SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset write-downs."       "Another thing they're criticized for is their lack of disclosure. We still haven't seen a balance sheet for the third quarter."       "People are saying, why don't you include a balance sheet with your results? They promised better disclosure in the past and that was meant to begin in the third quarter."       "You'd like to see just more information on asset write- downs and a discussion of their off-balance-sheet financing -- all these vehicles they have like Marlin and Osprey."       "We'd like to see some clarity, answering those sort of questions."       "It seems as though Enron at least are maybe at the start of a process where they're going to address and clean up their balance sheet and they've started to replace management."       "Investors have already had enough issues" in corporate bonds recently and "sometimes investors just think, 'Not another nasty in my portfolio,' and I'd rather exit."       "For certain investors maybe they just get scared. I wanted to know more about it. People had speculated if it could go to junk. I don't think they could because I don't think Enron could exist as a junk company."       "There's a certain reluctance" to sell the bonds. "You want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals."

"There are people out there with the experience and the contacts who see this time as a good opportunity to get into the market," a senior metals market source told Reuters on Thursday.  Such a move for Enron's metals portfolio would involve the acquisition of an existing organisation as a vehicle, the source added.  "We do not comment on rumours," an Enron spokeswoman said, declining further comment.  Other Enron Metals assets were also said to be in play, including the Henry Bath warehousing company, which operates LME-registered warehouses in the UK, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United States.  MAJOR PLAYER  Houston-based Enron became a major player in the metals trade in May last year when it acquired MG plc, a leading independent international metals dealing firm in London, in a deal worth around 300 million pounds.  The company is a ring-dealing member of the London Metal Exchange (LME), able to participate in open-outcry floor trade, and is active in screen-based metals trade via its EnronOnline platform (www.enrononline.com).  The company no longer has a stake in online metals trading platform EMETRA (www.emetra.com), having sold its holding to other EMETRA shareholders this summer.  But while Enron may be a heavy hitter in the metals sector, base metals trading could hardly be regarded as one of its core businesses.  The company's third-quarter 2001 results statement shows income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) from "Europe and other commodity markets" - which includes metals and steel alongside European gas and power, among others - of $53 million, unchanged from the year-earlier period.  This compares with IBIT from Enron's gas and power market-making operations and merchant energy activities in North and South America of $710 million over the same period.  But the third-quarter figure that has slashed the value of the company's shares is a $1.2 billion write-down of shareholder equity related to off-balance sheet transactions.  On Thursday the company said it would restate its earnings for 1997 to 2001 to reflect the transactions - a move which wipes $613 million of the company's reported net income from 1997 through the first half of this year.  The company's stock has dropped by almost 78 percent since Enron released its earnings results on October 16, falling to nine-year lows amid concerns about the company's ability to raise cash.  The story added an extra twist on Wednesday as news broke that U.S.-based energy trading and marketing firm Dynegy Inc. was in talks to buy out Enron.  Against this background speculation is rife about the future of the metals operation, fuelled by the company's decision last month to trim between 10 and 20 percent of its metals workforce as part of a wider staff reduction by Enron Europe.  UNLIKELY TO REMAIN INTACT  Any decision by Enron or a possible future purchaser to offload its metals operations would be unlikely to see Enron Metals remain intact, traders said.

Bush did not want to join the EAS but he worried that the EAS mightexclude the US from the region. We told our American friends that it could not be purely an Asian thing becauseAustralia and New Zealand were in it. In any case countries like Singapore would never want an EAS to be exclusive. What would threaten us most is if the world developed into blocs."So where do we end up today?"When I met PM Rudd I thanked him for helping to catalyse the thinking of ASEAN. Sonow there are two possibilities either an EAS expanded for Russia and the US or a separate ASEAN plus eight (includingthe US and Russia) configuration.

These sorts of discussions are nearly always off the record -- but the fact thatthey happened is not off limits. Petraeus was not in uniform but rather wore what looked to me to be a brand new perfectly tailored dark suit. I joked tohim that if I Twilt.--srgc that out of two dozen or so times I had seen Petraeus that this was the first time I'd seen him out ofuniform an ice cold shudder of fear would spread quickly through some political circles in DC.In August of 2007 I wroteoiece stating that folks should keep an eye out for the possibility that General Petraeus mightrun for President in 2012. In April 2008 Steven Lee Myers wrote a solid New York Times follow up titled "TheGeneral" referencing my earlier take.

In January 2010 Public Policy Pollin.q revealed that while Obama held a ten point lead over a potential wild card raceagainst Petraeus the General had some strengths. But the pollsters also noted that many in the American public justdidn't know enough yet about Petraeus to form an opinion:Finally our blog readers voted for David Petraeus as our wild card Republican this month and hisnumbers come out as a mixed bag. He has the largest deficit against Obama trailing 44-34. But at +13his net favorability is better than the President or any of the other Republicans we tested. The problem forhim is that the numbers break down 25/12- 63% of voters in the country don't know enough about him tohave formed an opinion. Who knows if Petraeus would actually have any interest in going into politics butif he did he would be introducing himself to many voters for the first time. President Obama himself according to what some of his aides have reported to me is quite taken with David Petraeusand respects his approach and thinking. Petraeus has also been respectful of the President -- although when pushed at a recent forum about how he might reactto a Presidential decision on Afghanistan that the General might not have liked Petraeus offered a cryptic rather thanclear response. (see above video)At the "First Draft of History" meeting sponsored by the Atlantic Monthly/Atlantic Media Group the Newseum and theAspen Institute; Petraeus when asked if he would support the President no matter what the result of the strategic reviewon Afghanistan responded that he "would continue to give the President the best professional military advice he could."Contrast that with Defense Secretary Robert Gates resoonOinato_the..saest.ipr.j. "We will salute and execute [thePresident's] decisions faithfully and to the best of our ability."But after spending an evening with General Petraeus and watching him closely for a number of years there is no way thatthis intelligent leader -- with whom I have some disagreements but respect -- could be comfortable with the Tea Partytakeover of the Republican political machine.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And from the WSJ:0 JUNE 21 2010 6:55 PM ETMcChrystal's Next Offensive?Relations between the U.S. military and civilians in the Obama administration have been tense since last year's three-month review of Afghan war strategy a state of affairsunlikely to be helped by a new profile of Gen. Stanley McChrystal the overall commander in Afghanistan that will appear in Rolling Stone magazine on Friday. In the eight-page article released to reporters on Monday ahead of publication McChrystal appears to belittle Vice President Joe Biden and accuses Karl Eikenberry the U.S.ambassador to Kabul of undermining his war plan within the administration. Asked by the Rolling Stone reporter about what he now feels of the war strategy advocated by Biden last fall â fewer troops more drone attacks â the article reports thatMcChrystal and his aides attempted to come up with a good one-liner to dismiss the question. "Are you asking about Vice President Biden?"McChrystal reportedly jokes. "Who'sthat?"Later in the article McChrystal turns more serious when asked about cables sent last fall to Washington by Eikenberry. The cables called into question the major troop increaseadvocated by McChrystal's team and the U.S.'s backing of Afghan President Hamid Karzai â views that the ambassador had not previously raised with McChrystal or his staff."I like Karl I've known him for years but they'd never said anything like that to us before" McChrystal is quoted as saying. "Here's one that covers his flank for the historybooks. Now if we fail they can say 'I told you so."The article titled "The Runaway General" has already caused nervousness inside the Pentagon where memories are still fresh of another blistering profile that got a topcommander in hot water: an August 2008 cover story in Esquire <hop://wvav.esquire.com/features/fox-fallon > on Adm. William "Fox" Fallon then commander of all U.S.forces in the Middle East and Central Asia. The article eventually played a part in Fallon's resignation two years ago. In that Esquire piece however Fallon appeared to directly contradict White House policy on Iran and other parts of the Middle East; the Rolling Stone article makes no suchallegation but rather is full of jokey put-downs of important Washington players. Comments in the article attributed to anonymous McChrystal aides are particularly harsh towards some senior members of the Obama administration including National SecurityAdviser James Jones and other leading politicians like Sens. John Kerry (D. Mass.) and John McCain (R. Ariz). They also make some unflattering references toPresidentBarack Obama himself saying the president didn't seem to know who McChrystal was when he appointed him to run the war early last year. Only Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who is portrayed as having strongly backed McChrystal's plan for Afghanistan is singled out for praise by the anonymous McChrystalaides. A spokesman for McChrystal did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Monday. Copyright 2008 Dow Jones & Company Inc.

Tensions between General Stanley McChrystal and the White House are on full display in an unflattering profile in Rolling Stone of the commander of USand NATO forces in the Afghan war. McChrystal jokes sarcastically about preparing to answer a question referring to Vice President Joe Biden known as a skeptic of the commander's warstrategy."Are you asking about Vice President Biden?' McChrystal says with a laugh. 'Who's that?'" the article quotes him as saying.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
8787,""Biden?' suggests a top adviser. 'Did you say: Bite Me?"McChrystal tells the magazine that he felt "betrayed" by the US ambassador to Kabul Karl Eikenberry in a White House debate over war strategy last year. Referring to a leaked internal memo from Eikenberry that questioned McChrystal's request for more troops the commander suggested the ambassador hadtried to protect himself for history's sake."I like Karl I've known him for years but they'd never said anything like that to us before" McChrystal tells the magazine."Here's one that covers his flank for the history books. Now if we fail they can say ?I told you so."Eikenberry himself a former commander in Afghanisan had written to the White House saying Afghan President Hamid Karzai was an unreliable partnerand that a surge of troops could draw the United States into a open-ended quagmire. The article revisits the friction between the White House and the military last fall as Obama debated whether to grant McChrystal's request for tens ofthousands of reinforcements. Although Obama in the end granted most of what McChrystal asked for the strategy review was a difficult time the general tells the magazine."I found that time painful" McChrystal says. "I was selling an unsellable position."An unnamed adviser to McChrystal alleges the general came away unimpressed after a meeting with Obama in the Oval Office a year ago just after thepresident named him to take over in Afghanistan."It was a 10-minute photo op" the general's adviser says."Obama clearly didn?t know anything about him who he was.. he didn?t seem very engaged."The boss was pretty disappointed" says the adviser. The profile titled "The Runaway General" portrays his aides as profane and intensely loyal to McChrystal while arguing the general has seized control overthe war on the military and diplomatic fronts. The four-star general also derides the hard-charging top US envoy to the region Richard Holbrooke and complains about a dinner with an unnamed Frenchminister during a visit to Paris."Oh not another e-mail from Holbrooke" McChrystal says looking at his messages on a mobile phone. "I don't even want to open it."In a hotel room in Paris getting ready for a dinner with a French official McChrystal says: "How'd I get screwed into going to this dinner?""The dinner comes with the position sir" says his aide Colonel Charlie Flynn.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
