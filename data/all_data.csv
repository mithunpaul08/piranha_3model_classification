Gas daily reported that the weekendtraded as low as $3.70.  Therefore, we are assessing liquidated damages inthe amount of US$16,000, the amount of which Lisa Feisst will invoice.  Iwould like to ensure that this problem does not happen again. Wildgoose isnot the swing market, and all transactions completed on your screen are firmas are all transactions, unless otherwise specified, with Wildgoose andAlberta Energy Company.  We, at Alberta Energy Company consider this aserious matter, not the dollar figure associated but the implications in theCalifornia market place and are treating it as such.

The total costs for all the projects amount to over $13 million. For every dollar of State funding, the participating agencies have earmarked an average of $5 each to achieve long term success in promoting alternatives to petroleum fuels. The Energy Commission's grant funding will also reduce the public agencies' alternative fuel cost by about $1.3 million over three years.Grant winners under the Commission's Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Program were: the City of Los Angeles, $250,000; City of Fresno, $250,000; City of Industry, through City of Industry Disposal Company, $196,427; City of Placentia, $225,000; City of Commerce, $250,000; County Sanitation District of Los Angeles, $250,000; the City of Temecula Rapid Transit Agency, County of Riverside, Rancho California Water District and CR&R Solid Waste Management through Downs Commercial Fueling, $250,000; The California Department of Transportation, San Luis Obispo County, California State University Channel Islands, California Polytechnic San Luis Obispo, Lucia Mar School District, City of Solvang and Santa Inez Transportation Company, through Delta Liquid Energy, $250,000; City of Colton, $250,000; and Southwest Transportation Agency in Riverdale, $150,000.The Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Program seeks to displace petroleum-based motor fuels and assist California in attaining health-based air quality standards. Top priority for the program is to deploy low-emission alternative fuel vehicles, especially for cities, counties, local educational agencies, State fleets and project participants of the Interstate Clean Transportation Corridor (ICTC).# # #For further information, contact:City of Los Angeles						Detrich B.

99,"Stephanie, Transwestern has been in discussions with ENA since very early December regarding the sale of the Enron Compression Services gas. The ECS off take is supposed to be 11,000 per day. The fact that ECS was not able to nominate their gas has been problematic for Transwestern in that it causes our line pack to be higher than it otherwise would be. When we began discussions, we were open to the idea of getting the full volume out of our system by the end of the month. If a nomination could have been made that resulted in a sale starting at the beginning of this week, ECS could have sold the entire 363,000 in December. At some point, it becomes unrealistic to expect to be able to do that. It has taken ECS so long to arrange for an agent that a now we are looking at selling the entire volume in just 12 days (~30,000/day). I was expecting the following two things from ENA, 1) confirmation from you that ECS was set up to sell their gas, and 2) a start date for a sale with some advanced notice. I would then have conferred with operations to see if it would be possible to move the entire 363,000 in December. I did not expect ENA to arrange the sale before circling back with TW. If I had known that you were about to close a sale, I could have arranged to be pulled out of my meetings Tuesday afternoon. I have advised Patti Sullivan that TW is able to deliver 25,000/d through the end of the month. The balance can be delivered in January. I am confident that things will run smoother in the future. Regards, Paul -----Original Message-----From: Miller, Stephanie Sent: Tuesday, December 18, 2001 8:24 PMTo: Y'barbo, PaulCc: Tholt, Jane M.; Boyt, Eric; Nemec, Gerald; Gay, Randall L.Subject: TWPL ImbalanceGreetings Paul: Eric Boyt advised that TWPL was not in a position to deliver the full volume of approx. 363,000 mmbtu for the remainder of the month for the account of Enron Compression Services.  This would have been good information to know BEFORE we sold the gas.  I left a couple of messages today but never heard from you.  Unfortunately, we have sold this volume, at your repeated request, and are not in a position to retrade the deal.  To the extent TWPL is unable to perform, please call Janie Tholt or Randy Gay to see if they can reduce the commited volume. I am scheduled to be out tomorrow but may have to come in for the afternoon. Please advise ASAP. Ragards, Stephaniex31688",0,1,1

The proposal would replace the existing 1,030-megawatt Morro Bay Power Plant units 1, 2, 3 and 4 with two, state-of-the-art, gas-fired, 600-megawatt, combined-cycle units, generating a total of 1,200 megawatts. Each new unit will consist of two gas-fired turbines and one steam turbine with two 145-foot-tall stacks. The total of four new stacks would replace the existing power plant's three stacks that are 450 feet tall.Hearings giving the public and interested parties a chance to comment on part two of the Staff Assessment will be announced in the next few weeks.Public participation is an important part of the Energy Commission's power plant certification process. People may get involved in a variety of ways.

117,"With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.In efforts to minimize confusion, we will convert all Stentofon addresses in EB1 to a 4000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then your new number will be 4364.)  We will also change all speed dials to reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group of this change.Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.Regards, Darren AdamikMgr.-Trading Technology Enron Net Works, LLC 713.853.4764 Office713-853-9828 Faxmailto:darren.p.adamik@enron.com",1,1,0

138,"Current Notes User:REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook client will be configured on your computer.After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook client is configured on your desktop.2. Remote access to your mailbox.After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) for remote access to your mailbox.PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA available from your home or when traveling abroad.HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doeSubstitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You will now be able to view your mailbox. PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things in OWA that you can do in Outlook.
