Gray, advised instructors to use \"individual discretion to decide the  disposition of their examinations once the exam has started.\"\nAmong the  options: delay the test until the lights return; postpone it until a  Saturday; grade the incomplete test; or cancel the exam altogether.\nProfessors are also encouraged to check a Web site to see if their exam rooms  have windows.\n\"In some classrooms,\" Mr. Gray noted, \"students may have  sufficient natural light.\"  The rolling blackouts could hit most of the campuses of the University of  California and California State University.\nThe two systems are embroiled in  a legal dispute with Enron Energy Services, a Houston-based company that, in  February, cut short a four-year contract to provide electricity directly to  the universities.\nFor now, the two systems -- among the largest energy  consumers in the state -- are being supplied by Pacific Gas and Electric and  Southern California Edison.\nThough several medical centers and the Davis, Los Angeles and Riverside  campuses of the University of California system are exempt from the  blackouts, the rest of the campuses have been put on alert.\nAt Berkeley, the warning from Mr. Gray only heightened pre-exam stress  levels.\n\"Stopping in the middle of a final would be detrimental to my grade because  I save the hardest questions until the end,\" said Heidi West, 20, a  sophomore majoring in political science.\nAaron Chung, a senior studying cognitive science, said it would be unfair to  grade half-finished exams because he often circled answers instinctively,  planning to return later with more care.\n\"The only thing I don't have a  problem with is if the professors give everyone A's,\" Mr. Chung, 23, said.\n\"You have to be under a lot of duress for that to happen.\"  Gary L. Firestone, a biology professor, said he would move his 500-member  class out into the sunshine and tell students to spread their blue books on  the grass.\nBut Jeff Good, a graduate student who teaches Introduction to  Syntax and Semantics, said he would probably cancel the exam because the  final counts for only 20 percent of the grade.\nThat is what Michelle Chen, a junior linguistics major in Mr. Good's class,  is hoping for.\n\"I would love a blackout,\" Ms. Chen said.\n\"I'm going to turn on my  air-conditioner.

predictably, it has found that the enforced price cuts  have kept competition down and kept Yell's market share up.\nThe reasoning behind OFT advice that annual real price cuts should be doubled  is closed to scrutiny until Mr Byers has a new BT undertaking.\nBut it appears  to argue that the market is still a monopoly, so Yell must be charging too  much, so prices should fall further.\nThe result, according to those formerly eager to buy Yell, is that a growth  business has been turned into a stagnant one, losing all momentum.\nThis  sounds typical of the dead hand of UK regulation.\nIt must strengthen the  resolve of BT's new leaders to remodel what the authorities so hate to the  greater advantage of shareholders.\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nOUTLOOK Outlook Houston needs to think small about future technology WILLIAM DYLAN POWELL  05/13/2001 Houston Chronicle 2 STAR 4 (Copyright 2001)  OK, it's test time - sort of like a breakfast-time Rorschach test for Outlook  readers.\nHere we go: What's the first thing that comes to mind when someone  mentions Houston?\nTime's up.\nYour answers may have been energy, medicine or seemingly random  acts of highway closure.\nBut how about something very, very small?\nWhile  Houston may not exactly be synonymous with all things tiny, we may want to  start giving more mind share to the world of the miniature.\nAs technology  advances, Houston may owe a great deal to the study of small substances.\nNanotechnology is the study of creating functional structures on a molecular  scale (the prefix \"nano\" means one billionth, or 10 to the ninth power  numerically).\nIts theories and practices give scientists the means to  construct useful entities using the smallest known particle of unaltered  matter.\nBefore your eyes glaze over in a terminology-induced science class flashback,  you should hear some of the possibilities that this technology could afford  residents of the Bayou City and their respective commercial enterprises.\nThe  possibilities give the works of science fiction author Ray Bradbury a run for  their money, and include producing computers the size of viruses or factories  that could fit neatly on your desk.\nCancer-destroying robots could roam a  patient's innards like mounted police at a spring break celebration.\nEventually, all diseases and mutations could be eliminated.\nAnd all  manufacturing processes would become waste-free, both in terms of the  environment and from a business process standpoint.\nSound like science fiction?\nMaybe, but truth is rapidly catching up with  fiction.\nA team of university researchers recently figured out how to make a  functional switch out of a single organic molecule.\nDiscoveries such as these  have spawned several branch fields of study including nanobiotics, NEMS  (nanoelectromechanical systems) and nanomedicine.\nThis technology would surely change the world.\nBut it would especially affect  Houston.\nApplications for nanotechnology are a great fit for Houston's  economic landscape.\nThe chemical industry already has begun conducting  research in small-sizing certain chemical compounds.\nAnd the energy industry,  still our darling, has great interest in the power management possibilities  of nanotech.\nThis could be Houston's next great vehicle for economic  development.\nNay-sayers have expressed caution regarding progress in this field on two  separate fronts.\nFirst on how distant potential commercial offerings remain;  and secondly on the potential dangers of combining genetic engineering,  nanotechnology and robotics (for fear of creating self-assembling intelligent  machines as often portrayed in science-fiction movies).\nBut too much  technological progress is happening at once for the possibilities not to whet  the appetites of the entire scientific and business communities.\nAlready, developmental overtures have been heard from Houston's little sister  to the north.\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth region and its growing base of  semiconductor, light assembly and defense industries are keeping a close eye  on developments in small science.\nIn March, a private-sector company donated  $2.5 million to the University of Texas at Dallas for nanotech research.\nAnd  a handful of Dallas-area groups have been quietly conducting research of  their own.\nThis money augments the federal government's nearly half-billion  dollar allotment of 2001 research funding for nanotechnology.\nHouston has its  own projects, but they receive far less publicity.\nHouston's public nanoscience efforts have been centered mostly on Rice  University's grand Turks of academia.\nPushing the envelope of academic  excellence as usual, Rice's heavyweight research barons continue to generate  and distribute knowledge on the many potential applications of this exciting  technology.\nBut as successful as they are, they receive far less publicity  and support than other less commercially significant disciplines.\nOn May 29, leaders from the energy, medical and technology sectors will  converge at the Houston Technology Forum to discuss various technology trends  that will affect Houston's future.\nWill the keynote speakers (chief  executives from Compaq, the Texas Medical Center and Enron) address the issue  of what Houston is doing to prepare for advances in nanotechnology and its  potential economic impact on the region?\nI certainly hope so.\nEnergy, medicine and technology are the terra firma of  Houston's economy.\nEach of these industry sectors could reap profound  benefits by bringing nanotechnology's concepts to light.\nSure, the fruits of this nascent science are still a long way off.\nBut it's  going to become remarkably important sooner than we think.\nSo while  Houstonians are well known for our love of largeness, it's time to think  small.\nLet's take a careful evaluation of what this technology could mean to  our city and its economic development.\nDrawing   Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nA Panel plots new course for area's future / Education, economics, quality of  life top group's list of needed improvements MIKE SNYDER Staff  05/13/2001 Houston Chronicle 4 STAR 33 (Copyright 2001)  A group of prominent business executives, worried that Houston's reputation  as an unpleasant place to live imperils its future, is developing a plan to  transform the city's educational system, urban design and economic base.\nThe work of the Center for Houston's Future, a nonprofit group affiliated  with the Greater Houston Partnership, reflects growing concern that Houston  must reposition itself as a vibrant, desirable destination if it is to  compete in an economic climate that empowers skilled workers to live wherever  they choose.\nCreating such a \"livable city,\" leaders of the effort say, would in turn  enrich the lives of every Houstonian.\n\"The interests of the business community are fully aligned with the interests  of the community at large,\" said Eugene H. Vaughan, a money management  executive and board chairman of the Center for Houston's Future.\nA report prepared for the organization by a business-based task force  recommends that local leaders challenge long-held assumptions that have  discouraged meaningful land-use planning.\nIt sketches a vision of Houston 20  years from now in which technology and other tools have revolutionized public  education, \"livable city centers\" have changed the physical landscape and  current civic leaders have groomed a new, more diverse generation of  successors.\nThe report argues that the business community's traditional leadership role  in Houston's civic affairs should continue.\nBut it suggests the models of  business influence that prevailed in \"the old days\" should be re-examined.\n\"Those were the days when oil was king, and Houston was the energy capital of  the world - the days when a handful of 'big' leaders, including CEOs of major  corporations, could meet in a room together and decide on the future of  Houston,\" the report states.\n\"But times have changed, and there is far less tolerance in Houston's highly  diverse, egalitarian society for a hidden oligarchy to run things, no matter  how benevolent those leaders might be.\"  The center's board includes top executives of some of Houston's most  successful and influential companies, including Enron Chairman Ken Lay; Ned  Holmes, chairman and CEO of Parkway Investments/Texas Inc.\n; James Royer,  president and CEO of Turner, Collie & Braden Inc.\n; William White, president  and CEO of WEDGE Group Inc.\n; and Jim Kollaer, president and CEO of the  Greater Houston Partnership.\nVaughan said the stature of the board members is an indication that the group  is not likely to generate plans that will simply sit on a shelf.\n\"They've got so many demands on their time that they're not going to fool  around with something that is ill-conceived,\" he said.\nRice University sociology professor Stephen Klineberg, one of the experts who  advised the task force that generated the report, agreed that the center's  work could be very influential.\n\"This is the first time there's been a systematic, coordinated effort on the  part of the business community\" to improve Houston's quality of life,  Klineberg said.\nThe Center for Houston's Future was created in the early 1990s primarily as a  source of research information for the partnership, Houston's premier  business organization.\nBut its role changed about two years ago, Vaughan  said, when Holmes became chairman of the partnership and encouraged the  center to take an aggressive approach to planning for the region's future.\nLast summer, the center organized three workshops attended by 36 people  representing a cross section of the business community.\nThese 10-day,  seven-night events, led by professional facilitators and featuring various  guest speakers, produced a report outlining four possible future Houston  scenarios.\nJames D. Calaway, a member of the center's board, said the details outlined  in the four scenarios are intended to be \"illustrative\" and are not  necessarily the actions the organization ultimately will recommend.\nHowever,  they provide insight into the direction of the group's thinking, he said.\nIn the first scenario, based on the assumption that local planning and  decision-making proceed much as they have in the past, the workshop  participants speculate that tension between the city and suburbs increases to  the point that the Legislature strips Houston of its annexation power.\nDevelopment is greatly restricted because of failure to meet clean-air  standards, property values plummet and the City Council must pass a large tax  rate increase.\nHouston becomes a stronghold of low-wage, service-sector employment, and the  gap between rich and poor widens: \"For many who live there, it's simply a  large urban sprawl, adrift in the global economy, or it's a three-year  hardship post on the way to something more desirable.\"  Scenario two suggests that Houston's leaders transform the educational system  by developing a \"Teacher Network\" that delivers Internet-based educational  resources into every classroom and teacher's home in the region.\nThis in turn  leads to a communitywide electronic educational network, with every home in  the Houston area connected to the Internet by 2007.\nThese efforts, combined with universal, full-day preschool care, lead to  state-of-the-art local schools by 2010, with almost universal high school  graduation rates and 75 percent of these graduates going on to college or  technical training programs.\nThe report does not estimate the cost of these measures or identify how they  would be funded.\nPotential sources, Calaway said, include local, state and  federal tax money, private grants and reallocation of funds now being spent  on more traditional educational programs.\nIn scenario three, local leaders take bold steps to overcome Houston's  reputation for sprawl, dirty air and lack of green space - perceptions that  hamper efforts to attract the talent needed to keep the region economically  competitive.\nThese leaders develop a vision of Houston based on the creation of \"livable  city centers\" - major activity centers targeted for redesign and  redevelopment - and the connection of these centers through \"personal and  public transport in corridors that delight the eye.\"  Within the centers, streets are reconstructed to better accommodate  pedestrians.\nFinancial incentives prompt developers to provide a wide range  of housing styles, including substantial affordable housing.\nThe Main Street  light rail line is built, succeeds spectacularly and is followed by more rail  lines extending in various directions.\nTo accomplish these goals, the report states, local leaders must overcome  their \"ingrained suspicion of planning,\" and the City Council must adopt  \"new, more prescriptive development standards\" within the livable city  centers.\nEarly successes lead to a public referendum authorizing the  expenditure of $8 billion over 20 years to create the \"livable city.\"  Scenario four focuses on making Houston a \"crossroads of the world economy.\"  The city's business leadership becomes broader and more diverse, and it turns  its energy toward diversifying the economy.\nThe energy industry, adapting to the new economic climate, transforms its  business model and creates new, high-tech enterprises.\nSpace, nanotechnology  and biotechnology research help launch hundreds of companies that quickly  become significant global players.\nThe workshop participants concluded that Houston must accomplish key elements  of scenarios two, three and four if it is to become a \"true world-class city  in which to live and conduct business.\"  Calaway and Vaughan said the next steps will include designating committees  to develop specific recommendations in each of the broad areas studied, such  as education and quality of life.\nWorking groups then will be established to  begin translating these ideas into policy, they said.\nAlthough the center is focused on the long term, they said, it must produce  results as soon as possible.\n\"If we do not get serious about this, 20 years from now we're going to be a  low-wage environment, putting people in very, very dead- end jobs,\" Calaway  said during a recent presentation on the group's work to members of the  nonprofit Gulf Coast Institute.\n\"We've got to get the quality of life right, but we've also got to make sure  that we educate these kids for our future.\"  Mugs:\n1.

At present, the Dolphin project is  being developed primarily as an upstream venture,\" an industry source told  MEED.\nAnother industry publication, Middle East Economic Survey (MEES), reported  last week that the two other partners regarded Enron's estimated cost for  constructing and laying the 350-kilometre (220- mile) undersea pipeline as  too high.\n\"There is talk of new partners,\" a source with TotalFinaElf, whose role is to  develop a block in Qatar's giant North Field, told MEED.\n\"But whatever  happens, we are staying.\"  On March 14, Qatar and the UAE inked a 25-year term sheet agreement on the  project, setting the volume at two billion cubic feet (20 million cubic  metres) of natural gas per day.\nDifferences over pricing and volumes had put back the signing of the  agreement for two years after a first statement of principle for Dolphin was  inked by Qatar and UOG in March 1999.\nAccording to MEES, Qatar Petroleum and UOG have finally agreed on a gas price  formula of 1.3 dollars per million BTU (British thermal units) following  \"high-level political intervention from Qatar and Abu Dhabi\".\nTotalFinaElf and Enron are strategic partners in the multi- billion-dollar  project, each holding a 24.5 percent share in Dolphin Energy Limited (DEL),  with UOG retaining a controlling 51 percent stake.\nFrom Abu Dhabi, the gas is to be distributed inside the emirate and on to  Dubai and Oman.\nAn extension to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline is also  planned, as part of a regional gas network.\nhc/rp  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nBUSINESS SMALL BUSINESS / Pleasure cruisin' / Yacht fleet owner offers customers what  amounts to limo service on the lake CAROL RUST Special to the Chronicle  05/13/2001 Houston Chronicle 2 STAR 1 (Copyright 2001)  KEMAH - Tom Lober trundled home from second grade with a three- tiered wooden  box he'd made at school.\n\"This is my houseboat,\" he told his mother 35 years ago.\n\"When I grow up, I'm  going to live on a boat.\"\nHis practical-minded mother put the \"boat\" to work as a patio plant stand  until it finally rotted from a decade of exposure.\nOn a recent evening, Lober stood on the bow of one of his four charter  yachts, enjoying the sunset-tinted water and a mild breeze as the 100-foot  luxury boat moved quietly from Clear Lake into Galveston Bay.\n\"This is what I love,\" Lober said, scanning a horizon dotted with distant  boats.\n\"The others are here to party, but this is it for me.\"  The founder and owner of Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts spoke calmly against  the din of a mini-Mardi Gras heating up on middeck, where bead-clad  executives were letting their hair down at their annual appreciation party  for a major customer.\nA Mae West look- alike hired for the event meandered  among them, handing out cigars and sultry comments in her mermaid-cut white  dress studded with faux pearls and a white feather boa twirled about her  neck.\nIn the eight and one-half years since the 42-year-old Lober started Star  Fleet, he's seen everything from fire-eaters to hula dancers as entertainment  on the hundreds of custom cruises his staff of 70 puts together each year.\nLast year, the company booked 400 cruises, which translated into $2.3 million  in gross sales, in events ranging from Gulf Coast versions of company picnics  to a bat mitzvah with a Gilligan's Island theme.\nOne guy recently plunked  down $2,000 to charter an entire boat for a date.\nOne of Lober's seven captains is, handily, a licensed minister for weddings.\nStar Fleet staff recently added squirt guns, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks as  regular on-board equipment.\n\"It's a bizarre business,\" Lober said.\n\"Nothing seems unusual anymore.\"  Nearly all Star Fleet's cruises include dinner.\nHis kitchen staff does the  prep work for hors d'oeuvres and main courses on land near the marina,  transferring them to a generous galley on board before customers arrive.\nThe  galley crew does the final cooking.\nStar Fleet Entertainment Yachts is one of about a dozen businesses of its  size in the country that provides strictly private charter yacht cruises, but  Lober has hundreds of competitors locally.\n\"I'm competing with caterers, hotels, restaurants - anyone in the eating,  drinking and party business,\" he said.\n\"People say there are two things  you're never supposed to own: a boat and a restaurant. I put a restaurant on  a boat.\"  Last month, he launched what he believes is the first-ever water limousine, a  30-foot yacht complete with wet bar, sound system, leather couches, TV and  VCR that takes small groups to waterfront restaurants and bars, just like a  limo does on land.\nSometimes, his clients hop off and dine at one of the restaurants on the  Kemah Boardwalk while the limo is anchored beside it.\nIn other cases, waiters  deliver the food to the boat, equipped with removable dining tables that can  seat 14, and the customers dine while cruising Clear Lake.\nLober was a natural shoo-in for a career on the water.\nHis father owned a  supply boat business in Houston and a fleet of shrimp boats based in  Trinidad.\nHe eventually became president of his dad's supply boat business  after getting a master's degree in maritime management from Texas A&M  Maritime Academy in Galveston in 1981.\nBut he still had that idea from second grade that grew from living on a boat  to providing exclusive entertainment on the water.\nIn 1986, he joined the Passenger Vessel Association, a national group of  vessel owners that provides public or private cruises for gaming, ecotourism  or other entertainment.\nHe attended seminars, talked to boat owners,  researched trends in the industry and tried to figure out what it would take  to float his idea.\nLober drew up plans for a boat big enough to accommodate up to 150  passengers, but with a three-foot draft to keep from running aground in the  notoriously shallow Clear Lake and Galveston Bay.\n\"I wanted to be able to take that boat anywhere on the lake,\" which is five  feet deep in places, he said.\nBankers were skeptical when he approached them for a loan.\n\"This was a new business in Houston that had never been done before,\" Lober  said.\n\"They had no confidence.  \"I finally got to the point where I'd just take my business plan into a bank  and say, 'I know I'm not going to get a loan - just look at what I've got and  tell me what it needs,' \" he said.  Even without a loan in place, Lober began hands-on research. During the week,  he still worked at his father's supply boat business, but flew to Fort  Lauderdale, Fla., on weekends to work as a deck hand and food server for a  charter yacht company to learn the business from the bottom up.  After a year of loan seeking, he found a lender at the Passenger Vessel  Association's annual meeting. Caterpillar Finance agreed to lend him 60  percent of the $950,000 in construction costs if he installed Caterpillar  engines on the boat.  Construction took a year, during which Lober continued his research, serving  drinks on weekends aboard a charter boat on the Detroit River and Lake St.  Clair.  Finally, Lober launched Star Gazer in October 1993.  The maritime academy might have taught him how to navigate by the stars, but  it didn't prepare him for marketing.  \"I didn't know what I was doing,\" Lober said. \"The first year, I spent  $125,000 in marketing blunders,\" including a $50,000 mass mail campaign that  he called \"a total flop.\n\"  Marketing was twice as expensive as he thought it would be and took twice as  long for potential customers to understand the concept he was trying to sell,  he said. Meanwhile, his boat sat in the stall for up to three weeks at a  time.  Lober had a $30,000 monthly overhead in debt service, office rental,  insurance and slip fees, and \"I still had to pay it if the boat didn't leave  once,\" he said.  Panicked, he joined the Greater Houston Partnership to seek out ideas, and he  got one: target marketing.  He and his small staff scrutinized every detail about the people who used the  boat and set out to find more like them. He set his sights on the corporate  client, which makes up about 70 percent of his business today. Corporate  customers include Enron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Continental Airlines and Katy  Mills mall.  \"We have had our party with Star Fleet every year for five years,\" said Ravi  Lal, director of ethylene division of Technip, based in San Dimas, Calif.  \"The first year, I wanted to do something special that I hadn't seen before.\nEverybody likes it, and everybody wants to come back.\n\"  Business slowly began to build, and word spread. Lober added the 90-foot Star  Cruiser in 1997, the 74-foot Star Spirit in 1999, and brought in a fourth,  the Lake Limo, last month. Also in 1999, he bought 6 acres with 600 feet of  waterfront and built Star Fleet Marina. While part of that land is still  undeveloped, it eventually will become a parking lot for 500 cars when Lober  adds a fifth large yacht, Star Ship, sometime in the future.  \"We plan to add Star Ship when we're turning down enough business from the  other boats,\" he said.  After more than eight years, Lober has yet to take home a salary, putting  everything back into the business.  The more he puts back, the more business he can accommodate.  But Lober and his staff still keep close tabs on their customers.  \"We track everything - which individuals, what type of event, whether they  prefer sit-down dinners, how they heard about us - you name it,\" he said.  It's a lot of details. He knows that blackout shades, pull-down projector  screens and multiple microphone jacks are needed for presentations, and that  some clients like to be picked up at one of the Galveston hotels or other  locations on the Houston Ship Channel.  If a customer hires a deejay, a crewmember provides padding to put underneath  the CD player on the bandstand because dancing on the steel dance floor  causes the player to bounce.  Lober's three full-time cruise consultants handle charter buses to and from  the marina, limos, menus, photographers and decorations. They work with Star  Fleet's in-house florist and theme designer to provide floral arrangements  for sit-down dinners and Hawaiian leis of fresh orchids and hibiscus for a  major retailer's party, for which the florist helped transform the boat's  stanchions into palm trees.  And consultants have their own suggestions, such as bestowing captains' hats  instead of the usual corsages to employees with top sales who were being  honored at a recent floating awards banquet.  Lober believes his company's custom service brings customers back.  \"They handle all the details once, and after customers go on that first  cruise, they're sold on the concept,\" he said. \"People love something  different.\nWe provide a different kind of party.\nIf they do it once, they  usually want to do it again.\n\"  But cruises aren't limited to parties, Lober said. Customers have chartered  boats for banquets, retreats, new product introductions, incentive awards  dinners and for scattering loved ones' ashes.  About 60 percent of Star Fleet's business is repeat and referral. The recent  corporate party featuring the Mae West look-alike was the fifth the company  has chosen to have with Star Fleet.  Part of Lober's initial marketing problem - which continues today - is that  Houstonians just don't realize how close to the water they are.  \"It's not like Fort Lauderdale, where water is part of the landscape,\" he  said. \"In Houston, there's no high-visibility location to see the water, just  one spot on Loop 610 that overlooks the Port of Houston.\nEven in Clear Lake,  there are only one or two places when you drive around the lake that you can  actually see the water.\nWe don't have a San Francisco Bay or New York Harbor.\nSo people have to be reminded.\n\"  He also has to deal with the misconception that only the very rich can afford  cruises, Lober said.  \"Some people think they can't afford a luxury yacht, but when they compare  our complete package with upscale restaurants, hotel banquet facilities,  country clubs and wedding manors, we are quite competitive,\" he said. \"And  our food is gourmet quality.\nJust like a five-star hotel, we never cut  corners.\n\"  Event cruises start at $40 per guest including food, bar, entertainment, tax  and gratuities.  Lober depends heavily on customer surveys to develop the service he and his  crew provide. And customers informally give Star Fleet staff new ideas with  some of the extras they bring aboard, such as the squirt guns, Mardi Gras  beads, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks.  \"We learn a lot from our customers,\" he said. \"We see what they do, take the  best and give it back to them.\n\"  Because customer surveys indicate that about 20 percent of Star Fleet's  business comes from being seen on the water, Lober and his captains make  their crafts as visible as possible whenever they take them out.\nThe real  opportunity for hot-dogging comes when a customer charters two or three  boats, and they raft up to become the Star Fleet flotilla, with customers  moving from one boat to another.\nA three-boat charter can handle up to 375  guests.\nBut one boat can still do a lot of advertising.\nAt the recent corporate party, Mae West joined the other revelers who were  slinging Mardi Gras beads at al fresco diners as Capt. Tony DeFore edged Star  Gazer close to the Kemah waterfront.\nThey may not have known it, but they  were doing a little of Lober's public relations work for him.\nAs the boat pulled back into the Star Fleet Marina, Lober pointed out a barge  under construction.\nWhen it is finished - by the end of the year, he hopes -  the bottom floor will be a galley for food preparation, the second the Star  Fleet office and the third floor an 1,800-square-foot apartment.\nIt will kind of resemble that three-tiered wooden box he brought home from  school years ago, Lober says.\nAnd he's going to live at the top.\nPhotos: 1-2.\nLeft: Star Gazer, first of the Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts,  launched in 1993, sets sail for Southshore Harbor earlier this month.\nFrom  left to right are bartender Bridget Byous, server Leona Clark, Cruise  Director Edith Mitchell and President Tom Lober.\nBelow: Cruise Director Edith  Mitchell unties the Star Gazer's bow line (color);\n3.

But like the recent Montek Singh Ahluwalia report maintains, such reforms  cannot be done overnight and will require minimum five to seven years before  they break even.  The sector has already seen major exits like Cogentrix and Powergen and if  the current trends are anything to go by it would not be long before Enron  too says Sayonara India, claim sources in the power industry.  IPPAI, an association for private power investments, feels that the flip-flop  by the government as far as power policies are concerned have made it  difficult for investors to take decisions.  \"Take this as an example at one time there were more than 200 MoUs signed up  for private power projects, the government provided counter guarantees for  eight projects, of which only three have taken off.\nOf this the Enron project  is already facing problems of nonpayment, says a senior source.\nAccording to estimates drawn up by financial institutions like Power Finance  Corporation an organisation responsible for monitoring the financial health  of the SEBs and helping them with their reform programmes almost all the SEBs  have registered a negative turnover.\nWhich is why the financing or  escrowability of SEBs across the country has been reduced to zero.\nAccording to Union power minister Suresh Prabhu, the states are now  responsive to changes and reforms and the recent drive initiated by the  Centre to work with the state governments was expected to yield results.\nBut this sector has seen far too many committees which have failed to yield  much hope and it is only sheer determination of SEBs and political will that  can help this backbencher.\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nIndia Power Min: New Power Deal With Enron Unit Possible By Himendra Kumar Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  05/12/2001 Dow Jones International News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\n)  NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India is hopeful the Maharashtra State Electricity  Board's power purchase agreement with the U.S. energy company Enron Corp.'s  (ENE) Indian unit Dabhol Power Co. can be renegotiated and the DPC's dispute  over payments be settled, the country's federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu  said.\nIn a weekend interview with Dow Jones Newswires, Prabhu said the very fact  that the DPC had come to the negotiating table for discussions on its power  price was an indication that Enron was keen to save its India project.\nA special panel, set up by the Maharashtra state government, met with  representatives of the DPC, for the first time Friday and agreed to another  meeting May 23.\nFriday's meeting lasted for more than two hours.\n\"I am of the view that a negotiated settlement is possible since the first  meeting of DPC with the Maharahtra state expert panel went off well. There  has been a positive response both from the DPC and the MSEB after the  meeting. The central government will also reciprocate by participating in a  meaningful dialogue. The next meeting will really decide on how it all goes,\"  Prabhu said.\nEarlier this week, in an e-mail to Dow Jones Newswires from Houston, Enron  Vice President John Ambler however, said, \"While we have constantly  maintained that we are open to continuing a dialogue towards resolving  issues, this (Friday) meeting should in no manner be construed as an open  offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract.\"  The Maharashtra state government contends that the price paid for electricity  from the Dabhol power plant, India's biggest-ever foreign investment at $2.9  billion, is \"unaffordable\" and seeks to renegotiate tariffs.\nA recent committee appointed by the government, the Godbole panel,  recommended that the power purchase agreement be renegotiated.\nDabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power.\nCritics object to Dabhol charging 7.1 rupees ($1=INR46.8825) a kilowatt-hour  for its power, compared with INR1.5/kwh charged by other suppliers.\nThe 2,184-megawatt DPC project in Maharashtra has been mired in financial  disputes after the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its main customer,  failed to pay the December 2000 and January bills.\nThe Godbole panel is  working toward lowering the DPC's power tariff and allowing the sale of  excess power to the federal government or its utilities.\nA restructuring of  the DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda.\nThe Maharashtra government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a  revised agreement within a month.\nThe DPC currently operates a 740-megawatt  naphtha plant contributing about 0.7% to India's installed capacity.\nEnron  has maintained that work will be completed by the year-end in the second  phase of the Dabhol project that will add 1,444 MW to its capacity.\nThe plant  will switch from naphtha to liquefied natural gas as a fuel source in 2002.\nTexas-based Enron has a 65% stake in the DPC and is the project's largest  shareholder.\nOther shareholders include the MSEB with 15%, and General  Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel Enterprises (X.BTL) with 10% each.\n-By Himendra Kumar, Dow Jones Newswires; 91-11-461-9427;  himendra.kumar@dowjones.com  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nIndia: Talks begin on Dabhol issue  05/12/2001 Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) -  Asia Intelligence Wire  MUMBAI, May 11.\nOFFICIALS of Enron India today met the expert committee  headed by Dr Madhav Godbole to discuss the fate of Enron's Dabhol Power  Company.\nMr A.V.

What does that mean?\"  Though none of those present at the meeting was willing to give more details,  senior State Government officials had earlier told Business Line that the  State would be willing to discuss phase II only after a decision on the  rebate slapped on DPC.\n\"Basically our strategy will be to bring the Rs 401- crore rebate payable by  DPC to the centre-stage,\" the official said.\n\"The company has not mentioned a  single word about the rebate in any of their letters to either the MSEB or  the State.

PETER DeFAZIO D-ORE.\nThe state of Oregon should consider buying investor-owned Portland General  Electric to help protect Oregonians from gyrations in the electricity market,  U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio declared Friday.\nGov. John Kitzhaber reacted politely and said he'll explore the idea, but  others said it's a long shot because of political, financial and timing  factors.\nCritics said the proposal appeared aimed more at attracting attention to  DeFazio's potential candidacy for governor than anything else.\nSeveral companies already are considering buying the utility, but DeFazio  said state ownership could help keep PGE customers' electricity rates low and  generate profits that could help the rest of Oregon.\n\"I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can  insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business  community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale  markets,\" said DeFazio, D-Ore.\nPGE serves about 725,000 retail customers, mostly in the Portland area, and  is owned by Houston-based Enron Corp.\nPGE's sale to Nevada's Sierra Pacific  Resources for $3.1 billion officially fell apart last month.\nOther possible  buyers include Northwest Natural and ScottishPower, which owns PacifiCorp.\nWhile Enron and PGE officials declined to comment Friday, legislative leaders  showed no particular enthusiasm for DeFazio's idea.\n\"I appreciate his efforts, but I don't think it's the right idea at this  time,\" said House Speaker Mark Simmons, R-Elgin.\nHe said the state already  has a package of bills aimed at spurring more energy production and  conservation.\nSenate President Gene Derfler, R-Salem, said he'd be willing to sit down and  talk with DeFazio.\n\"I would not just shut the door,\" he said, but he doesn't  plan to devote much work to the proposal.\nDerfler questioned whether state  government could run a utility as efficiently as a business.\nDeFazio said a PGE purchase would offer several benefits.\nState ownership  would put control of PGE in local hands instead of those of a faraway  corporation such as ScottishPower.\nFor PGE customers, state ownership would  provide some protection and stability in electricity rates.\nIt also would be  a good investment that would pay for itself and perhaps pump revenue back  into the state's coffers.\nThe purchase could be financed with tax-exempt bonds sold by the state.\nDeFazio said state Treasurer Randall Edwards had told him the idea was \"in  the realm of possibility.\"  DeFazio's idea is an intriguing one and could provide some benefits, said Bob  Jenks, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board, which represents  customers of investor-owned utilities such as PGE.\nJenks said the primary benefit would be that, if the state bought PGE, the  utility would be able to buy lower-priced electricity from the Bonneville  Power Administration, which is required to sell power at lower rates to  publicly owned utilities.\nHowever, a publicly owned PGE wouldn't be able to  buy the lower-priced BPA power for about five years because of electricity  sales contracts that already are in place.\nAnd even if PGE were able to buy lower-priced BPA power, that wouldn't  necessarily translate to lower electricity bills for PGE customers, Jenks  said.\nIn addition, he said it could increase rates for other publicly owned  utilities because the BPA has a shortage of cheap hydropower.\nThe state Public Utility Commission would have to approve any sale of PGE,  but outgoing PUC Chairman Ron Eachus criticized DeFazio's proposal, saying it  had the potential to increase rates both for PGE customers and for publicly  owned utilities.\nHe also said it seemed designed to get political attention  for DeFazio's potential candidacy.\n\"I think we're in the political season where people are proposing grandiose  schemes that aren't very well thought out, and this seems to be one of  those,\" Eachus said.\nDeFazio conceded that a high-profile proposal focused on a Portland-area  issue such as the ownership of PGE would be a good way for a candidate to  build support for a run for governor, but he said that had nothing to do with  his plan.\nYou can reach Dave Hogan at 503-221-8531 or by e-mail at  davehogan@news.oregonian.com.\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nCongressman suggests state buy PGE By CHARLES E.

(AP) - Congressman Peter DeFazio on Friday proposed that the  state buy Portland General Electric as a way to hold down power costs.\nThe Democrat outlined his plan after presenting it to Gov. John Kitzhaber,  who said he would ask his energy advisers to analyze it.\nPGE is Oregon's biggest electric utility, serving more than 700,000  customers.\nDeFazio said a state purchase of the company could insulate many  Oregonians from \"the craziness in power markets.\"  DeFazio said the state could buy the company by issuing revenue bonds and  have the utility operate as a public power entity.\nHe said the purchase would give the state a diverse mix of transmission  rights along with hydropower, gas, coal and renewable energy sources.\n\"While I have not exhaustively researched the proposal, it does appear to be  feasible,\" said DeFazio, an opponent of electric deregulation.\nEnron Corp., the Texas-based owner of PGE, is trying to sell the utility.\nSierra Pacific last month abandoned its plan to buy PGE for $3.1 billion,  citing increasing difficulties in the current market and the political  environment in the West.\nKitzhaber said he's not opposed to the idea of the state buying a private  utility, as long as it would benefit consumers.\nDeFazio said PGE has been a profitable company, and putting it in public  ownership could give it preference over private utilities for the Bonneville  Power Administration's hydropower.\nThe congressman's suggestion wasn't welcomed by the Legislature.\n\"Thanks, but no thanks,\" said House Speaker Mark Simmons.\n\"Philosophically, I think it's the wrong approach,\" he said.\n\"We have a  bipartisan package of bills dealing with the issue.\"  Among those are his measure to delay partial electric deregulation for large  businesses and a bill to speed up the process for siting temporary generating  plants.\nSenate President Gene Derfler didn't reject the idea, but said the  Legislature doesn't have enough time in the current session to take on a job  like a utility purchase.\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved."}

Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\n)  NEW YORK -- After more than two years of talks, Saudi Arabia is about to  announce its choice of international oil companies for three huge natural-gas  projects that will mark a reopening of the kingdom's energy sector to Western  investment, a quarter century after it was nationalized.\nBut the announcement, and the signing of memorandums of understanding early  next month, will mark only the beginning of serious negotiations on terms for  the three ventures, which together will need investment of some $25 billion.\nIt will be months before final agreements are signed.\n\"We expect to have an agreement -- a final agreement -- signed somewhere at  the end of the year, or, hopefully, the first quarter of next year,\" said  Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi in an interview last week.\nSaudi Arabia's 11-member Supreme Petroleum Council is expected to meet today  to endorse the companies recommended by a ministerial committee led by  Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal.\nIn the following week, Saudi Arabia  is expected to communicate its decision to the oil companies from both sides  of the Atlantic that have been vying for a role in the three projects.\nBy the  end of the month, the chosen consortium members and Saudi officials are  expected to agree on which three companies will lead the projects.\nThis will  be a prestigious role in a country that is the world's largest oil exporter,  has more than a quarter of the world's oil reserves and has the fifth-largest  reserves of natural gas.\nAs with any negotiations for such huge projects, industry rumors abound.\nAll  three so-called oil supermajors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch/Shell Group  and BP PLC -- have been mentioned as project leaders, particularly for the  plum Ghawar project, named after the world's largest onshore oil field, whose  environs are expected to yield large volumes of gas.\nThe Ghawar project,  known as Core Venture 1, is projected to require about $15 billion in  investment.\nCore Venture 2 is on the Red Sea coast.\nThe third project is in  Shaybah, a recently developed oil field in the kingdom's Empty Quarter, a  southeastern region bordering the United Arab Emirates.\nThe companies say they have no idea who will be named to the consortia, or  who the Saudis will choose from a short list of 11 companies -- Exxon Mobil,  Shell, BP, Chevron Corp., TotalFinaElf SA, ENI SpA, Enron Corp., Occidental  Petroleum Corp., Marathon Oil Canada Inc., Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum  Corp. -- to lead each project.\nBut they all have their hopes.\n\"We would be very disappointed if we are not the lead operator\" for the  Shaybah project, said Archie Dunham, Conoco's chairman and chief executive.\nSince Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah invited major oil companies to return to  the kingdom in October 1998, negotiations have focused on such broad issues  as the scope of the projects and their integrated nature -- from exploration  and production of gas to the making of petrochemicals and electricity -- as  well as the notion that the companies will need adequate returns on their  investment.\nSoon, the project leaders will have to start the bargaining on such issues as  the roles to be played by national champions Aramco and petrochemicals  company Saudi Basic Industries Corp.\n---  Alexei Barrionuevo in Houston contributed to

environmentalists and unions  often at odds with Republicans to major Bush supporters given private  sessions with Vice President Dick Cheney.\nThe vice president, Cabinet secretaries and others on a special task force  have solicited ideas behind closed doors, hoping the privacy would encourage  a free exchange of ideas.\nThe White House has declined to provide names of participants - even to  Congress.\nBut interviews with participants detail a massive outreach where diverse  interests have met with task force executive director Andrew Lundquist.\nCheney's time has been reserved for meetings with more select participants  such as power wholesaler Enron Corp. and the Edison Electric Institute, both  GOP donors.\nHouston-based Enron is the world's top buyer and seller of natural

though at the  same time it did create the biggest UK independent by floating off British  Gas' oil interests as Enterprise Oil.\nEnterprise is the only UK independent  that is more than a niche or regional player.\nAs such its E&P assets would be  a significant addition to an oil major, hence the persistently rumoured  interest in taking it over.\nAs the North Sea became more competitive and difficult, some of the UK-based  independents began to look elsewhere.\n\"Unlike US independents which have  always tended to be less interested in drilling outside North America, those  in the UK have always tended to be more sympathetic to exotic parts of the  world\", says Mark Redway of Teather and Greenwood.\nUnfortunately, the obvious exotic new province that happened to open up in  the early 1990s was the former Soviet Union.\nOne company, Ramco Energy,  dipped in and out very successfully, recently selling its 2 per cent stake in  the Azerbaijan International Oil Consortium for Dollars 150m (Pounds 104.8m).\nOther UK independents - Aminex, Soco and Dana Petroleum - ventured into  Russia and got stuck.\nWhile Aminex finds it hard to downplay Russia (because  it has little elsewhere), Soco these days stresses its Mongolia and Vietnam  operations.\nAnother UK independent, JKX Oil & Gas, went into Ukraine, a  country notorious for non-payment of energy bills.\nWith diplomatic help from  Tony Blair, the prime minister, JKX has just survived a legal attempt to rob  it of its Ukraine assets.\nTwo other independents have sunk more fruitful roots in Asia.\n\"Cairn Energy  now has as big a stake in Bangladesh's gas production as Shell, and it would  be left, if Enron (the US energy company) were to quit India, as the biggest  foreign player in India,\" says Iain Reid of UBS Warburg.\nPremier Oil is now a  substantial Asian gas company, with production in Burma, Indonesia and  Pakistan and long term contracts in Thailand and Singapore.\nBut there are risks in these Asian ties.\nThe obvious political one concerns  Burma.\nLast year the UK government asked Premier to quit Burma because its  presence was helping the military regime.\nPremier refused, and said it would  carry on.\nThe other risk, according to Mr Redway, is economic and it applies also to  Cairn.\nBecause there is no real world market for gas, Cairn and Premier are  \"very dependent on the strength of the local economies\".\nBut then, Mr Redway  is an analyst who believes that independents' competitive edge lies in  exploration rather than production.\nHe therefore rates Fusion Oil & Gas  highly as \"the purest exploration investment opportunity in the E&P sector\".\nDana similarly vaunts its exploration expertise, but to a different end.\nIts  goal, according to Tom Cross, chief executive, is to find oil and then swap  exploration for production assets.\n\"This avoids the expensive development  stage of building platforms and pipelines and so on\".\nThen at the other end  of the spectrum are production-focused companies, such as Paladin, Tullow Oil  or Venture Production.\nRoy Franklin, Paladin's chief executive, makes no  bones about his company's scavenger strategy, spotting rich pickings  overlooked by the majors.\nThe majors are not always ready to sell, particularly recently when the oil  price rise has widened the gap in price expectations between buyers and  sellers.\nBut Paladin was last year able to buy PetroCanada's assets in Norway, and is  this year interested in bidding for some of what the Norwegian state is  selling off.\nAs its name suggests, Venture Production, a private Aberdeen-based company  with North Sea and Trinidad operations, is focused on extraction, not  exploration.\nAnd so are other private companies such as Intrepid, Consort  Energy and Highland Energy, formed in the past three or four years.\nThis new  generation of company tends to be more cautious than the older one.\n\"Exploration has probably been the best way to destroy shareholder value,\"  says one executive.\nThe other risk the new oilmen want to avoid is the vagaries of the stock  market.\n\"By focusing on production, the new companies are more predictable in  terms of cash flow and earnings,\" says Mike Wagstaff, Venture's finance  director.\nCopyright: The Financial Times Limited  \t\t \t\t    News Bush energy team covers all the bases Sharon Theimer, Associated Press  05/14/2001 Chicago Tribune North Sports Final ; N 13 (Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune)  The White House team developing a national energy plan has met with more than  130 interest groups, from environmentalists and unions often at odds with  Republicans to major Bush supporters.\nVice President Dick Cheney, Cabinet secretaries and others have solicited  ideas behind closed doors, hoping the privacy would encourage a free exchange  of ideas.\nThe White House has declined to provide names of participants even to  Congress.\nBut interviews with participants detail an outreach program where diverse  interests have met with task force executive director Andrew Lundquist.\nCheney's time has been reserved for meetings with more select participants  such as power wholesaler Enron Corp. and the Edison Electric Institute, both  GOP donors.\n\"The way the task force is set up, they don't have the staff or time to have  a huge host of companies come through the door.

Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is  expected to meet on Tuesday and announce the oil majors chosen for its  multi-billion dollar gas investment opening, industry sources familiar with  the negotiations said on Monday.\nThe sources said the SPC is expected to name ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell  as lead players in three so-called core projects involving the kingdom's  upstream gas sector - off-limits to foreign oil firms since nationalisation  in 1975.\nSigning of memoranda of understanding (MOUs) would most probably take place  in early June, the sources said.\nThe anticipated announcement would mark the biggest advance in the kingdom's  gas initiative, valued at an initial $25 billion, since Riyadh unveiled its  energy investment opening over two years ago.\nBut the hard work has yet to start on the opening of Saudi Arabia's gas  sector, the world's fourth biggest.\n\"The fiscal regime and regulatory details  have not been developed,\" said one source.\nFINAL CUT  Riyadh is expected to trim back its original shortlist of 11 potential  foreign investors revealed last summer.\nThose companies had been grouped  under three core venture consortia - South Ghawar, Red Sea and Shaybah.\nFor ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell, securing the lead role in Saudi  Arabia's core ventures would entitle them to operate the package and get the  biggest slice of the projects, analysts said.\nOther industry sources said ExxonMobil, the world's biggest energy company,  was tipped for the top slot in core venture 1 (South Ghawar) as well as in  core venture 2 (Red Sea).\nRoyal Dutch/Shell was in pole position for core venture 3 (Shaybah), the  sources added.\nBoth oil supermajors already have significant foreign investment in the  kingdom and feature as top customers of Saudi oil, the analysts said.\nENERGY DRIVERS  An urgent need to create jobs and grow the economy are driving Saudi Arabia's  landmark energy opening.\nAnd analysts said big oil companies were prepared to help the kingdom achieve  those aims even if the return on their investment was relatively low.\n\"Major oil companies just cannot miss this opportunity,\" a source said.\n\"The  gas projects will show profits.\"  But just how much revenue oil companies will generate by selling water and  electricity in the Saudi domestic market remains to be seen.\nOn paper, at least, the kingdom's domestic gas sector looks set for  impressive growth.\nDomestic gas demand, now running at about 3.4 billion cubic feet per day, is  forecast to grow at more than seven percent a year over the coming decade.\nSaudi Arabia has meanwhile made clear that its prized oil sector, the world's  biggest, remains off limits.\nEven so, oil companies still hold out hope for eventual involvement in oil,  the kingdom's lifeblood.\n\"The companies are just as happy with gas, but oil remains the ultimate  objective,\" a regional analyst said.\n\"Saudi Aramco is still putting up strong defence barriers, but eventually  they could open up the oil sector once they feel comfortable working with the  majors.\"  The Saudi gas initiative seeks foreign oil companies' help in developing the  kingdom's known gas reserves as well as investment in downstream projects fed  by gas supplies, such as power and desalination.\nThe following companies have been shortlisted for the gas projects:  Core venture 1 (South Ghawar Area) - ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP ,  TotalFinaElf , Chevron and ENI .\nCore venture 2 (Red Sea Area) - TotalFinaElf, ExxonMobil, Marathon , Enron /Oxy , Conoco , Royal Dutch/Shell.\nCore venture 3 (Shaybah Area) -

(XOM), Chevron  Corp. (CHV), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and ENI SpA (E) for Core Venture 1,  the $15 billion South Ghawar Area Development.\nFor Core Venture 2, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental  Petroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and Exxon Mobil, Total Fina Elf,  Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) were listed.\nAnd for Core Venture 3, the Shaybah area, Total Fina Elf, Conoco, Phillips  Petroleum (P), Enron and Occidental, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Marathon Oil were  listed.\nWith all those shortlisted expected to play some role, the immediate and  essential question for each of the IOC's is whether they will be selected to  lead and operate a project, with Core Venture 1 the most sought after,  industry sources said.\nExxon Mobil and Shell have been tipped as frontrunners for this venture.\nThe operator's role will be more crucial than ever here as it will be  responsible for directing further negotiations on the projects at hand which  will lead to final deals probably by year end.\nAlso, operators are expected to decide and direct how the project's  individual and large components will be developed, details the Saudis haven't  finalized, sources said.\nThe three ventures have been estimated at a combined value of about $25  billion.\n-By Dyala Sabbagh, Dow Jones Newswires; 9714-331-4260;  dyala.sabbagh@dowjones.com  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nBusiness RFID chip will help speed up business  05/14/2001 The New Straits Times Main/Lifestyle; 2* 26 (Copyright 2001)  THE combination of recently developed \"stick-on\" Radio Frequency  Identification (RFID) chip technology with a global positioning system (GSP)  will transform and quicken the pace of doing business in the oil and gas  industry.\nAnd Malaysia must adapt to this shift to maintain her global positioning.\nGlobal management and technology consultant Global Energy Strategy Practice  which is working in partnership with Accenture Sdn Bhd wants to promote this  idea locally.\nGlobal Energy Strategy Practice partner Paul Spence said that applying this  latest combined technology, car owners can fill up a petrol tank without  resorting to human contact or to the use of a credit card.\nRelevant personal data embedded in the RFID chip would be machine read and  the required quantity of petrol delivered, as if right out of a science  fiction movie.\nThis surreal development is made possible through the application of  ubiquitous-commerce (u-commerce) whereby computers and machines communicate  with each other to affect an impression of an omnipresent intelligence.\nSuch technology is economically available today.\n\"There are technology  suppliers who are offering these capabilities.\"  The technology also has applications outside the oil and gas industry.\nCommunications between machines can now allow or deny access of individuals  to restricted zones.\nIn an interview in Petaling Jaya recently, Spence said: \"A lot of my clients  now are asking, whether that same technology can be used to restrict access  into hazardous areas, plants or production sites.  \"Can a warning alarm be fitted to the individual or to an assistant?\nThere  are lots of safety, health and environment applications around that.\n\"  \"Guru in the field\" is another potential application where a combination of  RFID chips, video cameras, personal digital assistants (PDA) and personal  computers can deliver distant technical advice on- site.  \"An industry client operating in the North Sea oil fields has a prototype  mounted on a workman's helmet which sends snap-shots to experts on the other  side of the world.\n\"The effect of this new combined technology on global financial and commodity  markets is to lock them in tighter correlation.  \"The days of being able to arbitrage for profits between geographical markets  are shortening within the energy industry.\nEnron which is the biggest oil  trader in the US is now hedging on weather derivatives.\n\"  Accenture partner Lim Beng Choon said that to compete globally, the oil and  gas industry in Malaysia would have to implement this new technology to  remain connected to global markets.

India: Godbole panel report may suggest MSEB bifurcation  05/14/2001 Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) -  Asia Intelligence Wire  MUMBAI, May 13. THE second part of the Dr Madhav Godbole committee report is  expected to be submitted to the State Government on May 15.  While the first part of the report recommended renegotiation of the power  purchase agreement with Enron's Dabhol Power Company, the second part is  expected to suggest bifurcation of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board,  sources said. The committee, which has been given the mandate to negotiate  with Enron officials to make DPC power more acceptable, had a marathon  meeting on May 11 to finalise the second half of the report. \"The committee has been considering the bifurcation of MSEB,\" a source said.  \"The idea is to try and separate the distribution from generation and  transmission.\n\" While generation and transmission can be controlled by the  State, there may be a suggestion to privatise the distribution arm. Over 1.5  lakh MSEB employees had gone on a strike to oppose a Bill to unbundle the  board into three divisions - generation, transmission and distribution - due  to fear of privatisation.  MSEB, the State's leading power company, has been facing huge losses due to  delay in payments and theft of power. The second part of the report is  expected to address the problem in detail.  Part one of the report submitted on April 10 had said: \"...none of the  solutions espoused for independent power producers, in general, and DPC, in  particular, is tenable without the reforms of MSEB, especially its  distribution business, which it shall address in part II of the report.\n\"  The report is expected to \"suggest appropriate measures to ensure that the  interests of the State, MSEB and electricity consumers of the State of  Maharashtra are properly and adequately considered, evaluated and  safeguarded,\" according to the terms of reference laid down when forming the  committee.  The committee originally consisted of Dr Madhav Godbole, Mr Deepak Parekh, Dr  E.A.S. Sarma, Dr Rajendra Pachauri and the State Energy Secretary, Mr Vinay  Mohan Lal. The MSEB Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, has been inducted as part of  the panel after the submission of the first part and before the beginning of  negotiations with Enron.

The Smart Investor Tertiary will be primary Indira Vergis  05/14/2001 Business Standard 2 Copyright (c) Business Standard  These are volatile times for world business. There are increasing jitters  that a slowing US economy could dampen prospects for the global economies.  Many developing regions, especially in Asia, are bracing themselves for a  bout of slightly lower growth.  But two countries, India and China which together account for about half the  region's gross domestic product (GDP_ will still continue to see their GDP  grow at six per cent, forecasts the Asian Development Bank. Many Indian economists agree with ADB's projections. In fact, they view the  prediction of a six per cent growth in India's GDP as benign. Nearly 54 per  cent of India's GDP is delivered by its services sector and a modest  performance by this sector, some economists say, will be enough to hold up  the GDP at six per cent. There are others who hope that better agricultural  performance could prompt the economy to hand in a better scorecard.  However, the Indian industry remains trapped in the doldrums, suffering from  a lack of consumer confidence and investments. Very few economists expect to  see signs of recovery sprouting any time soon.  An interest rate cut is considered vital by many to energise the sector. And,  they argue, there are certain economic indicators that encourage such a move.  Inflation is running at very low levels and the nation's foreign exchange  reserves are currently high enough to provide a strong defence to the Indian  currency. Surprisingly, our trade balance, which threatened to spiral out of  control by surging oil prices last year, has been contained. Since then, oil  prices have retreated and are expected to remain subdued. While a rate cut  may go some way in reviving sentiment and activity in the industrial sector,  stirring up consumer demand will still hinge on a normal monsoon.  Rain, rain, come again  For many economists, the prediction of India clinging to its current GDP  level is heavily contingent on a normal spell of monsoon this year.  \"According to our assessment, we believe the Indian economy will grow by  around 6.5 per cent this fiscal year,\" says Chetan Ahya, vice president at J  M Morgan Stanley Securities.  In 2000-01, agricultural growth withered under a poor monsoon and a  subsequent drought in many parts of the country. For the second year in a  row, growth in the sector sank below one per cent. It stood at 0.9 per cent  compared with 0.7 per cent the previous year. While agriculture accounts for  only 24 per cent of GDP, it remains the most keenly-watched sector by  economists. \"The performance of the agricultural sector is important because  of its linkages to the economy both on the supply side and on the consumption  side,\" says Mohan Nagarajan, chief economist at Credit Analysis and Research  Ltd (CARE). \"It would lead to a better performance of agro-based industries,\"  he adds.  More significantly, roughly 60 per cent of Indians still depend on  agriculture for their livelihood. \"A good crop means that demand for  everything, from everyday use goods like toothpaste to larger items like  tractors will pick up,\" says Nagarajan. Economists are hoping that a good  monsoon will budge growth in the sector to around 1.5 to 2.5 per cent.  In service of the economy  Another key sector economists will be watching out for will be services.  India's services sector ranging from finance, insurance, hospitality to  transportation and communication slowed its pace in 2000-01. With growth  weakening by a whole per cent to 8.4 in 2000-01, sluggishness in this  important sector has been blamed for dragging down the overall GDP. Most  economists expect the sector to post either relatively flat growth or edge  slightly higher this year. But, it's performance will be vital to ensure that  overall GDP holds at six per cent. \"Even if the agriculture and industry  numbers fall again but services sees even seven to eight per cent growth, it  will be enough to keep the GDP around six per cent,\" says Nagarajan.  Construction activity a services component that includes housing, roads and  other infrastructure projects demonstrated surprisingly good growth of 8.7  per cent and is expected to maintain the pace. Road construction is tipped to  show increasing levels of activity as work on the ambitious highway linking  Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Calcutta intensifies.  Chiming in will be the housing industry, benefiting in recent years from tax  reliefs and attractive financing schemes, and which have encouraged more  people to buy houses.  Another segment slated to witness good growth will be IT-enabled services,  says Morgan Stanley's Ahya. \"We are emerging as the services workshop of the  world,\" he says. IT-enabled services like call centres and data processing,  though currently generating tiny revenues, are slated to turn into big money  spinners in the years ahead.  The telecommunications industry will also see improving levels of investment.  \"The penetration of services is so low, that it has an intrinsic high growth  rate,\" says Ahya. For a taste of the market, consider this: out of the 100  Indians, only one uses the Internet and less than three own a telephone.  A good home show  And there could be a pleasant surprise in store for industry amid all the  gloom over its performance.  Adequate liquidity conditions are spurring expectations of a cut in interest  rates. Broad money(M3) a gauge of total money available in the economy  increased 16.2 per cent in 2000-01 against 14.6 per cent last year.  While the Reserve Bank of India had cut the bank rate in March, the belief is  that a further cut of 50 basis points is imminent. The bank rate the rate at  which the central bank lends to commercial banks currently stands at seven  per cent. Aiding the cause is the inflation data which shows the wholesale  price index at a tame 5.84 per cent. With economists betting that oil prices  will remain in the $24-28 a barrel range, inflation is not expected to  exhibit the oil price-inspired gyrations of last year. A cut could coax the  industry to step up activity, though admittedly, much would still depend on  rural demand.  Neighbours' envy  And while many Asian countries watch with increasing nervousness the impact  of an American downturn on their economies, India and China can afford to  remain relatively placid about global developments. That's because they are  less dependent on the US for their own economic health. That is expected to  shield them somewhat from being blown off-course like some other Asian  nations by the ill-wind of an American slump in demand.  With exports making up less than 10 per cent of India's GDP, its economy is  clearly not export-driven. In contrast, nearly 35 per cent of Indonesia's GDP  comes from exports, 57 per cent for Thailand, and 50 per cent for the  Philippines.  Yet, despite claiming only a small percentage of GDP, India's exports  remained a bright spot amid some gloomy economic data. Exports raced ahead 20  per cent to $44.1 billion in 2000-01. It was the second consecutive year of  good exports growth. On the flip side, imports rose, too, during the same  period to Rs $49.1 billion. But non-oil imports, however, declined 15 per  cent to $34.2 billion. That helped narrow the trade gap to $5.74 billion from  $12.79 billion the previous year.  Still, India can ill-afford to ignore completely the risks of an American  slump in demand. The US is India's largest trading partner and, in 2000-01, a  quarter of its exports headed to that nation. Besides, by taking in nearly 70  per cent of India's software exports, it is also India's most important  software exports destination.  Booming software exports accompanied by remittances by Indians living  overseas have been the primary factors exerting a calming influence on  India's balance of payments of position, especially in times of economic  turbulence. For example, last year, while a surging oil import bill  threatened to rattle the nation's trade gap, inflows from  invisibles(including income from software and Indians living abroad) came to  the rescue helping India limit its overall current account deficit.  It's a sobering realisation that has compelled the National Association of  Software and Service Companies(NASSCOM) to lower its exports forecast to  between $8.5 billion to $9 billion from its previous figure of $9.5 billion.  Earlier, it had also revised estimates for 2000-01 lower to $6.2 billion from  $6.3 billion. Still, observers say it isn't a cause for depression.  \"They are still talking about growth.\nIt is a decline in the growth rate and  not an actual downturn itself,\" points out John Band, chief executive  officer, ASK-Raymond James and Associates. And remittances look set to  maintain their pace as well. \"Most remittances are still from Indians who  live in the Middle East, and I don't see any slowdown from this segment,\"  says CARE's Nagarajan. Remittances totalled $9.8 billion in the nine months  to December 2000. Software exports brought in $4.6 billion during the same  period.  Foreign institutions support  Another recent 'feel-good' sign has been evident in the stock markets too.  Between January and April 2001, eigners poured in Rs 7,368 crore into India's  equity markets - a phenomenal 15 per cent more than what they invested in the  whole of calendar 2000.  Yet, experts aren't reading too much into it. In the past few months,  investors have been fleeing from a shower of profit warnings in the US and  seeking cover in alternative investments. As they rejuggle their portfolios,  some money will inevitably flow into India and other countries, experts say.  Because it isn't affected so much by what's happening externally, they see  India as some kind of a safe haven,\" says ASK's Band.\nYet some hesitation  Recently, gunning for more foreign direct investments (FDI), the government  opened more sectors for foreign and private participation, including  pharmaceuticals, hotels, banking and astonishingly, even defence.\nHowever,  tempting FDI has always been a vexing issue for India.\nIn 2000-01, FDI did improve slightly, moving 26 per cent higher than the  previous year to $2.4 billion.\nYet, China a market India is frequently  compared with in terms of size and potential attracted 20 times more FDI in  the same period.\nEconomists now shrug off FDI as a tool to kick-start  investment in the country.\n\"It's a pittance and it probably will remain  stagnant,\" says an economist at a foreign research house.\nThe reasons are not hard to find.\nForeigners seeking to invest in India have  many fences to cross.\nFrequent changes in sector policies, chaotic  infrastructure facilities and nightmarish bureaucratic redtape have often  left foreigners tired and wary of doing business in India.\nThe stress of investing in India is most clearly visible in the recurring  concerns that have stubbornly dogged US energy giant Enron's 2,148 MW power  project in Dabhol in Maharashtra.\nAfter being forced to renegotiate a power  supply deal in 1995 after concluding it in 1992, Enron has hit the headlines  once again.\nThis time, an almost bankrupt state electricity board (SEB) refuses to pay  its dues for power received and the state government refuses to honour its  commitment to pay in case the SEB defaults.\nIt's led to intense speculation  that, after suffering repeated snags for nearly a decade, Enron might simply  pull out of the project altogether.\nA disturbing turn of events, since, till  recently, Enron Corp was the biggest foreign investor in India.\nIt will not be the first time that exasperation will have egged on a foreign  investor to pull out of a project.\nEarlier, US-based Cogentrix Energy had  also walked out of its $1.5 billion 1,000 MW Mangalore power project citing  endless bureaucratic hurdles.\nAnd there has also been some disappointment over India's much-hyped 300  million middle class which was supposed to be growing rapidly.\nMany  international firms, inspired by this figure, had scrambled to set up  operations to conquer a huge chunk of this market.\nNow many are struggling to  break even and still learning to adapt to local tastes a key ingredient for  success.\nThat's why despite all its attempts to open up various sectors,  India still remains a tough sell.\nOutlook  With a little help from the rains, India could notch up a growth rate of six  per cent.\nMany economists have also pointed out that a reforms-studded budget  could also inject some enthusiasm in the patient that is the economy.\nStrong  measures include plans to reform labour laws and government employment.\nThese  are expected to boost the economy's development, though in the long run.\nThe recent opening up of various sectors could also revive sentiment,  although whether this will translate into FDI flows is arguable.\nStill, every  bit helps.\nThe fact remains that it will have to persist in trying to  accelerate the pace of growth if its ambitions of turning into an economic  powerhouse are to be realised.\nAfter all, for the second most populous nation  in the world with one of the biggest markets, its economic power is still  nowhere near the figure its size suggests.\nAcegas shares, potential for growth (Acegas, le potenzialita di crescita del  titolo)  05/14/2001 La Repubblica 41 Copyright (C) 2001 Abstracted from La Repubblica in Italian; Source: World  Reporter (TM)  Italian brokers Rasfin SIM have indicated the potential for growth in the  shares of Acegas, the former municipal utility of the Italian city of  Trieste.\nAcegas closed the first quarter of this year with turnover of L137bn  (+45 per cent).\nResults attributed in part to the start of production of  Estenergy, a consortium of the utilities of Udine, Trieste, Gorizia and Enron  of the US, which supplies energy and services to parts of Friuli.\nAlso significant, according to Rasfin, were investments over the period,  which totalled L43bn.\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nA Section IN THE LOOP Al Kamen Roundabout to the Oval Office Al Kamen  05/14/2001 The Washington Post FINAL A19 Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co.\nAll Rights Reserved  Sometimes even Cabinet officers can lose their way in the White House.\nSo  there was Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G.

Edmonston  10/22/2001 Dow Jones Business News (Copyright\n(c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\n) The Wall Street Journal Online  Stocks rallied sharply Monday despite the widening anthrax scare, as a batch of better-than-expected quarterly earnings reports cheered investors.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 172.92, or 1.9%, to close at 9377.03 after gaining 40.89 points Friday.\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index rose 36.75, or 2.2%, to 1708.06 after climbing 18.59 points in the previous session.\nOther major stock indexes gained ground Monday.\nThe Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 16.42 to 1089.90, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 7.13 to 561.45, and the Russell 2000 Index gained 4.80 to 430.50.\nBonds were mixed and the dollar strengthened.\nThe stock market's gains were tempered briefly by news that a postal worker in Washington, D.C., was diagnosed with anthrax contracted by inhalation.\nAdditionally, two other postal workers in Washington have died and their deaths are being investigated to determine if they died of that same ailment.\nBut stocks took the anthrax reports in stride, suggesting a new and surprising level of confidence among market participants, some analysts said Monday.\n\"The market is really shrugging off this news,\" said Mark Donahoe, a managing director at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.\nUpbeat earnings news from American Express, released Monday afternoon, seemed to give stocks an additional lift.\nInvestors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and U.S. military maneuvers in Afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results, said Steven Kroll Sr., managing director at Monness, Crepsi & Hardt.\nThe uncertainty on the global front \"looks like it is going to be a long, drawn-out affair,\" Mr. Kroll said.\n\"I think stocks will revert back to being earnings-driven.\"  Although dismal by ordinary standards, last week's flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors, who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations.\n\"The markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings,\" said Mr. Donahoe of U.S. Bancorp.\nThat resilience might be giving hope to investors this week, he added.\nStill, investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up, Mr. Kroll argued.\nThird-quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on Monday, with big companies such as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing and U.S. Steel posting results that met or topped analysts' estimates.\nThe Dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p.m.\nEDT when index component American Express reported earnings that, excluding certain items, beat Wall Street previously lowered estimates.\nThe financial-services concern posted net income of $298 million, or 22 cents a share, down 60% from $737 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier.\nExcluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the September 11 attacks, American Express said it would have earned $595 million, or 45 cents a share, for the latest quarter.\nAnalysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.\nShares of American Express surged after the quarterly earnings release, closing up 3.4% at $30.32.\nChip stocks helped lead the Nasdaq composite higher, with the Philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5.4%.\nThe rally seemed to be a continuation of Friday's gains in the sector, sparked by positive earnings news from KLA-Tencor.\nU.S. Steel, the nation's No. 1 steelmaker, said it swung to a third-quarter loss from a profit a year earlier, hurt by oversupply and a weak economy.\nBut excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another, U.S. Steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.\nShares of U.S. Steel rose 9.7% to $14.74.\nInvestors also sent 3M shares nearly 5% higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by Wall Street estimates, despite a 21% decline in net income.\nAnd oil producers Conoco and USX-Marathon Group handily beat analysts' forecasts.\nBut not all the earnings news was cheery.\nLocal phone company SBC Communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates.\nShares of SBC, a component of the Dow industrials, fell 5.1% to $41.40.\nMeanwhile, the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging, some analysts noted.\nOn Monday, 3M guided Wall Stret's earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter, and a top executive at U.S. Steel told analysts that the company's fourth quarter would be \"difficult.\"  Companies \"are meeting third quarter expectations, but they are talking down the fourth quarter,\" said Mr. Kroll of Monness Crespi & Hardt.\nHe said that some of the rise in Monday's markets might be a carryover from Friday's buying activity related to the expiration of U.S. stock option and index option contracts, an event known as \"double witching.\"  One of the hardest-hit stocks on Monday was Enron, an energy concern that said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was seeking information about certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer.\nShares of Enron plunged 21% to $20.65.\nOverseas, stocks closed higher.\nLondon's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index gained 1.1%, while Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index rose 2%.\nEarlier in the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.3%, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended 0.3% lower.\nIn economic news, the Conference Board reported that its index of leading indicators for the month fell 0.5% in September, matching the estimates of economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets.\nThe index -- a composite of measurements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy -- included some data gathered after the Sept. 11 attacks.\nThe decline, which was the index's largest one-month drop since January 1996, confirmed that the widespread weakness in the U.S. economy is deepening, the Conference Board said.\nFalling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the September reading.\nIn August, the leading-indicators index slipped 0.1%, less than the previous estimate of a 0.3% decline.\nEven so, the back-to-back declines paint a bleak economic picture, said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein.\nThe two-month decline in the index suggests that the already-weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year, Mr. Goldstein said.\nThe overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown.\nIn major U.S. market action:  Stocks rose.\nOn the Big Board, where 1.09 billion shares were traded, 1,813 stocks rose and 1,291 fell.\nOn the Nasdaq, 1.49 billion shares changed hands.\nBonds were mixed.\nThe 10-year Treasury note rose less than 1/16 point Monday, or 62.5 cents for each $1,000 invested.\nThe yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 4.618%.\nThe 30-year bond fell 1/16 point to yield 5.364%.\nThe dollar rose.\nThe dollar bought 122.56 yen, compared with 121.20 yen late Friday.\nThe euro traded at 89.18 U.S. cents, down from 89.84 cents late Friday.\nCopyright\n(c) 2001 Dow

Houston, Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares fell 21 percent after the Houston-based company said the Securities and Exchange Commission requested information on partnerships run by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives.\nEnron, the largest energy trader, created partnerships and other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets such as power plants to lower the debt on its books.\nAn investor sued Enron's board Wednesday, saying two partnerships cost the company $35 million and Fastow's leadership of them was a conflict of interest.\nInvestors today said they were concerned that Enron may be forced to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the owners in cash or stock.\nChief Executive Ken Lay said last week he may be have to \"unravel\" agreements that created the companies if Enron's debt ratings fall too far.\n\"We need confidence their long-term credit rating won't go below investment grade,\" said Roger Hamilton, an analyst at John Hancock's value funds, which own 600,000 Enron shares.\nEnron reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion when it repurchased 55 million shares of two such partnerships controlled by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LMJ2 Co-Investment, the Wall Journal reported last week.\nDismantling more of the affiliated companies and partnerships would cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, Ray Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to investors today.\nEnron shares fell $5.40 to $20.65.\nThey touched $19.67 during the day's trading, the lowest level since Jan. 15, 1998.\nShares Plunge       The stock has fallen 75 percent this year amid concerns about failed investments in trading of space on fiber-optic communications networks and a water company, and the resignation of Jeff Skilling as CEO in August after seven months on the job.\nWhile Skilling said he resigned for personal reasons, investors say his departure led them to question whether the company was concealing problems, including possible liabilities from affiliated companies.\nOn Tuesday, Enron surprised many investors when it reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, the result of writing off $1.01 billion in failed investments.\nMoody's Investors Service placed the company's debt on watch for possible downgrade.\nThe company's debt is rated at investment grade by Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's.\nThe company received a faxed request for information from the SEC on Wednesday asking for information, spokesman Mark Palmer said, and will respond \"as soon as possible.\"       \"We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest,\" Lay, who is also Enron's chairman, said in a statement.\nDilution Fears       Enron has formed at least 18 companies to serve as financing vehicles for its projects, based on filings with the Texas secretary of state.\nFastow and other Enron executives are named as the controlling partners or the board members in the companies.\nSome have bought Enron assets such as power plants, removing the debt for those projects from Enron's books.\nThat allows Enron to keep cash earned from the main trading business from supporting what it views as secondary businesses, Standard & Poor's debt analyst Todd Shipman said.\nEnron brokers trades of electricity, natural gas and other commodities as well as owns power plants and natural-gas pipelines.\nDismantling the affiliates would be costly.\nWhitewing Management, an affiliated company that has bought 14 Enron power plants and lists Fastow as managing director, holds 250,000 preferred shares of Enron.\nEnron may have to convert the preferred shares to common stock if share prices fall below a certain level and the credit rating drops below investment grade, according to company filings.\nThat would dilute the value of common shareholders' investment.\n\"The concern is how many of these dilutive structures are out there?\"\nShipman said.\n\"Investors are worried they might have to share their Enron earnings with a lot more people than they originally thought.\"                          Worrisome Financing       Enron's auditors and attorneys reviewed the company's \"related party arrangements,\" the board approved them, and they were disclosed in SEC filings, Enron said in its statement.\nThat hasn't eased concerns.\nThe reduction of shareholder equity by $1.2 billion from the LJM partnerships is reason to worry about Enron's other financing vehicles, wrote Niles, the Salomon analyst.\nEnron also may take another $2.4 billion in losses from investments in the Dabhol power plant in India and projects in South America, he wrote.\nEnron's 8 percent coupon bonds due in 2005 fell $34 per $1,000 face value to be offered at $1,022 today from $1,056 on Friday, traders said.\nYield on the debt rose to 7.33 percent from 6.33 percent.\nBased on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long- term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above investment grade.\nFastow continues to work, and Enron hasn't punished him, Palmer said.\nFastow declined to be interviewed, spokeswoman Karen Denne said.\nSEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on the agency's request to Enron.\n\"We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done,\" Lay said in the statement.\nUniPrime Signs Letter of Intent for Wind Energy Park Project  10/22/2001 Business Wire (Copyright\n(c) 2001, Business

Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis lowered his rating to \"hold\" from \"buy\" on Friday.\nHe said he has been looking for discussion of the partnerships in Enron's SEC filings and is only seeing \"vague references\" that don't leave him with a \"good comfort level.\"       With Heim's rating change, Enron went from being the second most highly rated stock in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index to the 10th, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.\nToday, Zach Wagner at Edward Jones & Co. in St. Louis cut Enron to \"reduce\" from \"accumulate.\"\nRatings by Edward Jones, which caters to individual investors rather than institutions, aren't tracked by First Call.\nFirst Call translates analyst ratings into numbers, with \"strong buy\" a one, \"buy\" a two, and so on, then averages the ratings to rank a company's Wall Street popularity.\nThe most highly rated stock is Tyco International Ltd., which has fallen 12 percent this year.\nEnron shares fell 86 cents to $19.79 today.\nRemaining Skeptical       However highly brokerage analysts rate the stock, \"I have to remain skeptical,\" said Barry Borak, energy analyst at David L. Babson & Co., which manages $60 billion in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\"There's been a huge loss of management credibility at Enron,\" Borak said, because of the partnerships and the unexpected departure in August of Jeffrey Skilling, who had held the post of chief executive officer for six months and was heir apparent to Lay.\n\"Nobody I've talked to thinks (Skilling's departure) is for personal reasons,\" Borak said.\nSkilling helped transform Enron from a gas pipeline company into the biggest energy trading company.\nEnron also owns power plants in deregulated markets.\nBorak said Babson doesn't own Enron shares and won't be a buyer \"until I can get better, more thorough information about what else might pop up in the future.\"       Borak and other investors said Enron has a reputation for not providing enough information about its businesses, and they said this makes the positive view of the company on Wall Street more difficult to understand.\nAfter Skilling resigned, Lay said the company would be more open about its businesses.\nA bullet point in his talk in Boston was \"increased transparency of financial and operating results,\" according to a handout provided at the Boston meeting.\nAmazed, Dismayed       Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale wrote in a note to clients last week that she was \"amazed at the willingness of Enron's management to break out earnings and expenses to the degree that it disclosed in the third quarter.\"       Coale also wrote that she was \"dismayed by the apparent 'disguise' of the additional $1.2 billion equity hit that was not disclosed in (Enron's) press release and was briefly mentioned in the earnings conference call.\"\nCoale kept her rating on Enron at \"buy.\"       Phelps at John Hancock said that his \"cynical side\" believes that investment banking business has helped keep Wall Street recommending Enron stock.\n\"They provide some good underwriting business,\" he said.\nCredit Suisse First Boston managed a secondary sale of 12 million Enron shares in 1999, with Lehman Brothers acting as co-manager.\nCredit Suisse has also managed bond sales for Enron this year.\nEnron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1) 2001-10-23 16:38 (New York)  Enron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)       (Updates with closing share price in sixth paragraph.)       New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the biggest energy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750 million loan, ensuring access to credit if the company is cut off from money markets, say people familiar with the matter.\nEnron's shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating its finances.\nThe company depends on a $3 billion commercial paper, or short-term debt, program to finance day-to-day operations.\nMoody's Investors Service last week placed all $13 billion of the company's long-term debt securities on watch for possible downgrade.\nAny drop in the rating may cut off Enron from the commercial paper market, raising the costs of short-term debt.\n\"We understand that our credit rating is critical to both the capital markets and our counterparties,\" Enron's Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow said on a conference call today.\nHe said Enron has $3.5 billion available on bank credit lines, giving it enough cash to operate normally.\nDan Noonan, a spokesman for Citigroup's Citibank NA unit, declined to comment.\nMark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, also wouldn't comment.\nShares of Enron, based in Houston, fell 86 cents to $19.79.\nThey have fallen 76 percent this year.\nComplex Financing       An investor sued Enron last week, saying dealings with two partnerships run by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, cost the company $35 million.\nThe suit also calls Fastow's leadership of the partnerships, set up to remove debt from Enron's books, a conflict of interest.\nEnron bought back 62 million shares to unwind positions in some partnerships run by Fastow, said Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay on the conference call with investors today.\nThe number of shares differs from a Wall Street Journal report on Thursday that said Enron had bought back 55 million shares.\nThe buyback reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion, the Journal said.\nThe company set up the partnerships and other affiliated companies to buy Enron assets such as power plants.\nThe partnerships allow Enron to take debt off its books, letting it borrow to invest in its main business of commodities trading, Enron said.\nEnron trades electricity, natural gas, oil, coal and other commodities.\n\"'They have complex off-balance sheet financing,\" said Commerzbank analyst Andre Mead.\n\"It's difficult to ascertain the full impact on shareholders.\"       The SEC has asked Enron about partnerships and affiliated companies headed by Fastow.\nThe company has at least $3 billion in such \"off-the-books\" financing in affiliated companies, Ray Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to investors.\nDepends on Asset Sales       One partnership, Whitewing Management, owns 250,000 preferred shares that Enron may have to convert to common stock.\nWhitewing partners can demand their preferred shares be converted if Enron common stock falls below a certain price or if Enron's credit rating drops under investment grade.\nWhitewing and other Enron partnerships and trusts include company executives as officers and directors, according to records from the Texas secretary of state.\n\"Over the life of these trust structures, Enron has in fact issued a sizable amount of equity,\" Enron Treasurer Ben Gilsan said.\nMost of that was shares issued to Enron executives as part of a deferred compensation plan, Gilsan said.\nThe Whitewing partnership was financed with $1.4 billion in bonds sold last year.\nThe partnership used some of the proceeds to buy Enron power plants and plans to retire the debt by selling them, officials said on the conference call.\nOther company partnerships operate with the same strategy.\n\"Some investors are worried the asset sales won't cover the full amount (borrowed), and Enron will have to furnish support to the detriment of shareholders,\" said Commerzbank analyst Meade.\nCommercial Paper Rates       Enron was paying 3.15 percent to issue commercial paper until Oct. 31, which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies with the same \"A2/P2\" short-term credit ratings that are not on credit watch.\nEnron's short-term debt is not on review for a possible downgrade.\nBased on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long- term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above investment grade.\nFitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's rate the company's debt at investment grade.\nEnron has previously turned to Citigroup for finance and advice.\nIn 1999, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit advised the company on its $1.45 billion acquisition of three natural gas- fired power plants from Cogen Technologies Inc.\nCitibank, along with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., this year arranged a $1.75 billion loan.\nHow Enron Blew It Texas Monthly November 2001  Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon= ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo= st important company in the world.\nNow its stock is down, wall street is be= arish, and the CEO is gone.\nWhat went wrong?\nby Mimi Swartz <http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.p= hp> =20 THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th= e international headquarters of the best and the brightest.\nThe lobby in no=  way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c= ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby.\nEnron, in contrast, throbs with mod= ernity.\nThe people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b= rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born.\nT= hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif= orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu= blic button-downs.\nAlmost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin= g intently, like winners.\nEnron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-= size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva= tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe= ople entering from the garage.\nA sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti= pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi= s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe= inated.\nMulticolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula= ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e= levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: \"From the World's = Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!\"  For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro= m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000= .\nIt was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per= cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil= lion to $100 billion.\n\"The very mention of the company in energy circles th= roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,\"=  notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma= rket intelligence to the energy business.\nThis Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine= d to transform American business.\nHired sixteen years ago as a consultant b= y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old = formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then = selling it to refineries and other customers.\nInstead, it evolved into a co= mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=  to electricity, from wind to water.\nIf you had a risky drilling venture, E= nron would fund it for a piece of the action.\nIf you wanted your megacorpor= ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job.\nIf y= ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning = power needs, Enron was there to build and build.\nBasically, if an idea was = new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra= ck.\nAnd with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny.\nT= he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo= rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe= eded Lay as chief executive officer.\nEnron, says Skilling, \"was a great mar= riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me= ntality of the financial markets.\"  The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en= d of the twentieth century.\nLike the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=  was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ= an economy.\nMaybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a = culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t= he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh= o could see the future versus those who could not.\nThe key was investing in=  the right kind of intellectual capital.\nWith the best and the brightest, a=  company couldn't possibly go wrong.\nOr could it?\nToday Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of = $80 in January.\nThe press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene= rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=  his relentless defense of the free market.\nA long-troubled power plant pro= ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions.\nTelecommunications= , in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded.\nWall Street analysts who o= nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices.\nSome of the cha= nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer= tain times that has afflicted all of American business.\nBut the culture tha= t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.\nENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD \"a totally different way of thinking about b= usiness-we got it.\"\nAt Enron, in fact, you either \"got it\" or you were gone= -it was as simple as black and white.\nIt is not coincidental, then, that th= e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he = once headed.\nHere, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga= ny floors.\nBlack leather trims the edge of snowy carpets.\nBillowy sofas set=  off the jet-black baby grand.\nIn the entry, white orchids cascade from a b= lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar= ble.\nThere is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil= ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus= t six months as CEO.\nOnce, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene= ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame= rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc= hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, \"someone cou= ld actually get killed.\"\nToday, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr= istmas morning.\n\"I had no idea what I'd let go of,\" Skilling says of all th= e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.\n=20  From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=  photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies.\nThe demands o= f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances.\nDivorc= ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash= er.\nHe almost missed his brother's wedding.\n\"Learning a foreign language-I = never learned a foreign language!\" he exclaims.\nHe never once took his youn= gest son to school.\n\"I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte= en-minute scheduling.\"\nTravel: \"You can't go to Africa for a week and get a= nything out of it!\"\nSkilling includes the study of architecture and design = on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs.\n\"I'm not sure=  that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,\" he says, finally= .\nThen his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it= s pragmatic edge.\n\"It would have been easy to stay,\" he says.\n\"But that wou= ld not have been good for me.\"=20  He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand= some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi= duously stolid gaze.\nBut the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=  underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r= eporters who have labeled his resignation \"bizarre\" and associates who are = bitterly skeptical of his need for family time.\nHis shrug stretches the lim= its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=  upon.\n\"I'm surprised,\" he says, \"that people have so much trouble understa= nding this.\"  PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni= neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo= lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building.\nFrom nine t= o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist= ine silver skyscraper to smoke.\nThey perched on the chrome banisters or lur= ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad.\nThey always looked=  hurried and furtive, even ashamed.\nWhatever people knew about Enron in tho= se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th= at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters = in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=  the energy world of the past.\nWhat macho engineer would have put up with s= uch humiliation?\nBut this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti= es when chaos enveloped the gas business.\nFederal deregulation of natural g= as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque= ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v= olatile free-for-all.\nThe situation was compounded five years later by fede= ral deregulation of the pipeline business.\nSo it happened that a gentlemanl= y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=  from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm.\nHNG wa= s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc= o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy.\n(His doc= toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V= ietnam War.)\nLay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar= dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H= NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat= e of Texas.\nHNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte= mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska = pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i= n the country at the time.\nThen, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=  in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like = Coastal.\nWhat the Nebraskans blithely labeled \"the purchase\" was being call= ed \"the merger\" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular= ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr= avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru= nning a new company called Enron.\n\"Over time it became clear that Lay had a=  better vision of the future,\" says one person associated with Enron at tha= t time.\n\"He never fought change. He embraced change.\"  Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean?\nEnron was saddled with massive=  debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had = exclusive use of its pipelines.\nWithout new ideas-for that matter, a whole = new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s= tarted.\n=20  LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha= d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h= ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I= llinois.\n(His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) \"I l= iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,\" he told Busines= sWeek earlier this year.\nBut unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling = wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he = was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w= hat he would come to call \"intellectual capital.\"\nHe loved being smart, and=  he loved being surrounded by smart people.\nHe graduated from Southern Meth= odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too= k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi= s class.\nThen Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-= up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as = a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20  It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless= , and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company.\nSkilling was above=  all an expert at markets and how they worked.\nWhile everyone else was worr= ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al= one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses.\nAnd so in a world w= here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=  called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th= e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers.\nEnron would not be = a broker but a banker.\nIt would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the = risk involved.\nAnd Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv= estment bank would.\nSkilling worked up some numbers and found them \"absolutely compelling.\"\nThe= n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec= utives.\nHe had a one-page presentation.\n\"Almost to a person,\" Skilling says= , \"they thought it was stupid.\"\nAlmost.\nAfter Skilling left the meeting dej= ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized.\nLay listened and th= en said, \"Let's go.\"  The Gas Bank was not an overnight success.\nFor months Skilling woke up in a=  cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze= ns of colleagues who had assisted him.\nIn fact, he had come upon one of tho= se divides that seem to define his life: \"I believed this whole world would=  be different, a huge breakthrough\" is the way Skilling puts it today, and = even if he is typically immodest, he was right.\nFairly soon after launching= , the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week.\nTrue to Skilling's = character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=  joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, \"We were in= .\"\nAnd he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr= on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo= r him.\nIn 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit= .\nAfter that, says Skilling, \"we never looked back.\"  Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha= d a trading component.\nMyriad trades were needed to build the market that w= ould make the project go.\nBut by buying and selling enormous quantities of = gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin= ate it.\nThe company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b= est access to supplies.\nThat, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted = to be part of the play.\nWith so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b= etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m= ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p= rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi= th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could = have ever imagined.\nTHIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m= ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin= ess.\nThe idea was to build a \"knowledge-based business,\" which demanded a s= kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days.\nMos= t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o= f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=  industry regulated by the federal government.\nBut now the company needed b= older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make = money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company.\n\"Enron was going to=  create a niche for itself or die,\" one former executive explains.\n\"The peo= ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na= rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.\"\nSkilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people.\nHe wanted the s= martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice.\nAnd be= cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he = wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big= gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B= oston.\nIn addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be \"a= ggressive.\"\nYou were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w= ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.\n=20 You could see what he was looking for on \"Super Saturdays\" at the Houston h= eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee= n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=  day.\nThey were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a= bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called \"a sense = of urgency.\"\nPeople who scored less than 2.5 were scratched.\nThe shrewdest = candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t= he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing = Enron would come back with more.\nThe starting salary was around $80,000.\nMa= ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more = than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof= ts being renovated close to downtown.\n(Enron people didn't live in far-flun= g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)\nFor the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a= nd-talented program.\nNew associates learned the latest techniques for struc= turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g= lobe.\nThe hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of.\nA com= pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=  with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th= e house, planning a vacation.\nOf course, a lot of people who worked for Enr= on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou= ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers.\nIf they were ov= erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra= m.\nMassages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t= en at night.\n\"They were so cutting edge,\" rhapsodizes someone involved with=  the company health care program at the time.\n\"They really thought about th= e psychology and what it took to keep these people going.\"\nSkilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts= , associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos= e titles didn't really matter.\nMoney did.\nInstead of competitive salaries a= nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus= es-with no cap.\n\"If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=  make a lot of money,\" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un= til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div= ision.\nOr, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed.\nGas traders = with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus= .\nAnd the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join= ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of= f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp= ectacular Mexican villa.\n\"Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'= d say,\" one loyalist says.\n=20 And why not?\nBy 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m= erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market.\nBut at a company where the b= uzzword was \"aggressive,\" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie= ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.\n=  Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv= ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega= n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa= ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se= rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer= e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo= rts).\nBut the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling.\nIn 1997 Ken Lay m= ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company.\nBy then, = the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar= gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity.\nThe divisio= n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $= 2 billion to $7 billion.\n\"Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil=  in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,\" the New = York Times noted.\nEveryone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill= ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran= sforming another.\n\"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,\"=  sang the New York Times in 1999.\n\"In the staid world of regulated utilitie= s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,\" crowed For= tune in 2000.\nWall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl= e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million= , up 30 percent from the previous year.\nThat year the company seemed to dis= cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste= el, and even weather.\nNo one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=  client.\nPeople drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg= e against the usual winter downturn?\nBut most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c= ommunications.\nBecause of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be= came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o= nline in 2000.\nEnron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi= d price and the asking price.\nThen there was the broadband business: To Enr= on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt= y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi= ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines.\nSo Enron created a market for wha= t the industry calls bandwidth.\nSoon after, it also announced a twenty-year=  deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=  in their homes.\nEnron looked like a company that couldn't lose.\n\"Its strat= egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo= dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,\" BusinessWeek insis= ted.\nThere was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: = the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers.\nThe old notion of c= ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust= omers to keep them.\nBut Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t= o come to it.\nOver time, the company stopping referring to its business cli= ents as customers and began calling them \"counterparties.\"\nSkilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m= aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=  overtaxed and overregulated.\nSo if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur= e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi= l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un= derwrite the project, if it ever would.\nBut because Enron invented its mark= ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals= , from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene= d at all.\n=20 While many businesses used what was known in the industry as \"mark-to-marke= t accounting,\" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale.\nThe c= ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=  idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge= t deals.\nAnd while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an= nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front.\nHow= ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=  went on the books in the current year.\nIf a few analysts thought there mig= ht be something fishy about what they called \"subjective accounting,\" inves= tors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in.\nAs the mark= et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec= t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't = going to be high enough.\n\"Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,\" = says one former employee.\nWinning the highest possible profits for the comp= any could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity.\nWhen a fundraiser=  for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c= ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe= ting literacy charity: \"Even the person who was supposed to give money away=  for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,\" he says.\nAs Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created = took on a dark side: The competition turned inward.\nAs one member of the En= ron family put it, \"It became a company full of mercenaries.\"\nThe change st= arted at the bottom.\nAs Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most = of the recruiting frills fell away.\nNew associates were treated much like t= he commodities the company traded.\nGlobal Change's Enron spies reported ove= rhearing orders like \"I need a smart person-go buy me one\" or \"Buy me an in= telligent slave, quick.\"\nEnron had never been the kind of place where peopl= e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa= rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months.\nIt was to= o disruptive.\nPeople couldn't get their work done.\nAnd, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension= .\nThe Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S= killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s= ystem in the country.\nEmployees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t= hose with fives were usually gone within six months.\n(The PRC's nickname qu= ickly became \"rank and yank.\")\nIt was a point of pride that Skilling's divi= sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year.\nAs one Skilling assoc= iate put it, \"Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=  store.\"\nSkilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro= n's attitude toward its workers.\nIn time, it would become many workers' att= itude toward the company.\nTeamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur= e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus.\nIf protocol required an Enr= on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=  he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m= ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.\nEveryone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: = \"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s= ight of the future,\" says one former employee.\nAnyone who couldn't close de= als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u= ps who had backed them.\nPast errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte= n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase \"No old tapes\" became a= n Enron clich?\n.\n\"People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,\" says=  one former Enron executive.\nIn such a hothouse, paranoia flowered.\nNew contracts contained highly restr= ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.\n=  E-mail was monitored.\nA former executive routinely carried two laptops, on= e for the company and one for himself.\nPeople may have been rich at Enron, = but they weren't necessarily happy.\nOne recruiter described the culture thi= s way: \"They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y= ou bleed to death.\"\nBEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy = company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J= ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i= ts remaining old order.\nWhere Enron once prized cautious executives who dea= lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d= ealt with intangible assets.\nPipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr= on's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone.\nExpensive, long-term building pr= ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm= ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it.\n\"It wasn't the tim= e for long-term approaches,\" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.\n=  \"It was the technology era.\"\nTo rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe= cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job.\nMark was for many ye= ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n= ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th= e requisite Harvard MBA.\nMark was largely responsible for the success of En= ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed = $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o= f Enron's profits in 1998.\nFor this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on= e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including = two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo= rate America.\nBut then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi= a, one of the largest ever constructed.\nShe had played the game the Enron w= ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p= ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c= hanges in government.\nBut the time and expense needed to make India and oth= er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals= , and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.\nForcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter.\nKey executives left, divisio= ns were dismantled, but she remained.\nThe truth was Enron didn't mind firin= g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen= tless people it tended to promote.\nThe company preferred humiliation-keepin= g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=  deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title.\n(One particularly d= ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.)\nA company a= s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=  visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa= ster.\nSo Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar= k her own company.\nDespite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, = Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti= lity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri= vatization.\nMark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate= st water company.\nAzurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth= er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.\n=20 But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a = business fraught with political and emotional complexities.\nWater is not li= ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=  it up, even for lots of money.\nThe company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an= d confidence evaporated.\nBy August 2000 the stock price, which had started = out at $19, had fallen to $5.\nMark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=  diminished, was folded into Enron.\n\"I think it's best for Rebecca to start=  afresh,\" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.\n=  Or as one critic put it, \"They were more interested in destroying the old = culture than running a business.\"=20 As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command.\nIn December Ken Lay=  announced the inevitable: \"The best time for the succession to occur is wh= en the company is doing well,\" he told the press.\n\"Enron is doing extremely=  well now.\"\nIn February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.\nALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED.\nEnron's domination of the electric-= power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac= le.\nBoth PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t= he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L= ay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg= e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo= od or electricity.\nSkilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent = anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=  the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif= ornia, as both tried to buy power online.\nThe Times reported that Lay had t= ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d= eregulation.\nThe bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=  was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we= aknesses.\nBy late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=  January.\nWithin Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline.\n(The = India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of = constant turnover within Enron's management team.)\nBut the California situa= tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th= at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population = and never properly managed those it had.\n\"For three months Gray Davis did a=  very good job of blaming us,\" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo= rate communications.\n\"We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi= te House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big= gest contributor was a Texas energy company.

But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al= l too apparent lack of contrition.\nFacing down his critics, he cracked a jo= ke comparing California with the Titanic.\n(\"At least the Titanic went down = with its lights on.\")\nBut the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had = been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price.\nInvestors=  believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=  it had revolutionized gas and power.\nEnron estimated the global market for=  buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi= on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst.\nSo too d= id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster.\nFor the first tim= e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma= rket.\nLike the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=  Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.\nSkilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t= he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant.\nD= uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal= lenged Enron's financial reporting an \"asshole.\"\nWhen the company reported = hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit= s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse= ts.\nIgnoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr= omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner.\n\"Th= ere wasn't any positive news,\" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n= ow.\n\"Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.\"\nThe business press, so generous in the past, turned surly.\nFortune had aske= d in March whether Enron was overpriced.\n(\"Start with a pretty straightforw= ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?\")\nThe routine cashing = in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray= ed in the media as a fire sale.\n(Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L= ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.)\nThen the Wall Street Jour= nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with= in the company.\n(It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl= e failures.)\nEvery negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th= e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40.\nEnron, so institutio= nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine.\n\"When Wall Stre= et is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,= \" says Carol Coale.\n\"When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca= rry more weight.\"\nThis fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e= xperiencing an attack of conscience.\nThose who had looked the other way as = the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec= retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th= eir ways.\n\"It just created an attitude,\" one executive still at Enron says.\n=  \"If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard?

investors and analy= sts had already expressed displeasure at: Fastow, with the approval of Enro= n's board, had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman and=  LJM2 Co-Investment.\n=20 The partnerships, which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron,=  served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments.\n=20 But Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of = Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time.\n=20 So Fastow, in June, resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also e= nded its relationships with the LJM entities.\nDuring the third-quarter, Enr= on took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2=  billion reduction in shareholder equity.\n=20 Tuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously fo= llowed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected=  in dealings with the LJM partnerships.\nHe said a \"Chinese wall\" existed be= tween Enron and LJM.\n=20 Fastow's replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron's treasurer befor= e moving last year to another job with Enron.\nMost recently,

setup.\n=20 Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available f= or comment Wednesday.\nHe also didn't know whether Fastow is still receiving=  a salary.\n=20 Enron disclosed on Monday that federal securities regulators had begun an \"= informal inquiry\" into the LJM dealings.\n=20 The news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor = confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, wate= r and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skil= ling in August for personal reasons.\n=20 A continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followe= d the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry.\n=20 Wall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron's various fina= ncial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give=  analysts enough data to make proper evaluations.\n=20 Beyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partne= rships Enron set up.\nAmong the worries is that Enron will end up having to = issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entiti= es.\n=20 Investors wouldn't like that because it would dilute the value of current o= utstanding shares.\nThey are also afraid that Enron's debt credit rating may=  be downgraded, which could have negative impacts on its overall

Thistime around they will not be able to block the move any more. The Indian  lenders alone cannot save the controversial $3 billion as some of the foreign  lenders are in favour of issuing the termination notice,\" said a source.\nThe  Indian lenders are in favour of completing the project without any time and  cost over-run.\nThey have disbursed about 80 per cent of their Rs 1,500 crore  worth of loan commitments to phase II of the project, 93 per cent of which is  complete.\nThe trial run is expected to commence in June.\nThe board of the  Dabhol Power Company has already authorised Enron India managing director, K  Wade Cline, to serve a termination notice as and when he deems fit.\nAt a  meeting of the lenders last month in London, the foreign lenders were keen  that the termination notice be served in the face of defaults by the  Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Union government's refusal  to honour the counter-guarantee of Rs 102 crore for the December bill.\nThe  domestic lenders are not covered by the counter-guarantee if the contract is  terminated.\nThe foreign lenders are covered by the counter-guarantee.\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nEnron to suspend investments of 600 mln usd in Brazil energy sector  05/15/2001 AFX News (c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd  SAO PAULO (AFX) - Enron Corp will suspend investments of 600 mln usd in the  Brazilian energy sector, news agency JB Online quoted Enron vice-president  and Eletricidade e Servicos SA Elektro chairman Orlando Gonzales as saying.\nOf the total investment, 500 mln usd was to be assigned to the expansion of  the thermoelectric plant Cuiaba II in the state of Mato Grosso, and in the  construction of Rogen in the state of Rio de Janeiro, with the remainder to  be invested in unit Elektro, it said.\n\"There are no clear regulations for the sector.

(SCG) said in a  statement on Tuesday it will add around 200 million cubic feet a day, or  about six percent, to its pipeline system by the end of the year in order to  meet the surge in demand for gas-fired power generation.\nToday's announcement comes two months after SCG, a unit of Sempra Energy ,  proposed to increase capacity on its system by 175 mmcfd, or five percent.\nBoth projects will add around 11 percent of new gas capacity to its  transmission system this year, the company said in a statement.\nIn its latest proposal, called the Kramer Junction Interconnect, SCG said it  would build a 32-mile pipeline link to the Kern-Mojave pipeline system that  will allow it to deliver around 200 mmcfd into its system.\nThe new capacity would be enough to drive three 500-megawatt power plants or  enough gas to serve 1.4 million residential customers a day, the statement  said.\nSCG, the nation's largest gas utility with more 18 million consumers in  central and Southern California, said utilization of its intrastate  transmission system in the past nine months had jumped from 75 percent to  over 95 percent, due largely to the rise in gas-fired power generation.\nThe company's announcement is the latest in several proposals to expand gas  pipeline capacity to California, where demand for gas is expected to jump  because of the number of gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for  construction.\nGas is already used to generate about a third of California's electricity.\nAnd since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant  projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts.\nNine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than  6,000 megawatts, are under construction.\nOver the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving  California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos' Kern  River Transmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave  Pipeline Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group,  Questar Corp.\n, Calpine Corp.\n, and Kinder Morgan .\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nEnron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity Market-Nikkei  05/15/2001 Dow Jones International News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\n)  TOKYO (Nikkei)--Asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese  companies save as much as Y4 trillion, major U.S. energy firm Enron Corp.\n(ENE) on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market  by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and  distribution, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported.\nEnron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power  plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to  households.\nIf such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to  match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector  could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said.\nAt a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company  asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity  auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant  benefits to end-users.\nNew suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the  entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant  facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies.\nRegarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation  facilities asserted that \"industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are  stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the  U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia.\"  In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which  last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity  supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a  company official.\nEnron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to  spin off different operations, analysts say.\nIf the number of power  generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's  electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business  interest.\nSplitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and  distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new  entrants.\nThis will boost transparency in the fees that electric power  companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power  generation facilities, Enron says.\nCiting the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector  has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution  must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nEnron Agrees to Provide Market Data to NGX  05/15/2001 PR Newswire (Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)  CALGARY, May 15 /PRNewswire/ - NGX Canada Inc.

The industry has been very supportive of the visibility and  integrity we are able to bring to the Alberta Gas Price Indices, which  removes the guesswork around gas price index methodology. However, after  reviewing the matter with Enron and other industry participants, we  recognized that Enron had legitimate concerns and the industry felt that  \"more is better\". The inclusion of data from the highly liquid EnronOnline  system should improve the quality of our price indices even further.\"  Rob Milnthorp, President and CEO of Enron Canada commented, \"We are very  pleased to have EnronOnline transactions included in the Alberta Gas Price  Indices. This will provide industry participants with a more comprehensive  source of data and a better opportunity to manage risk around these price  indices as they are now assured that all their transactions on EnronOnline  will be included in the computation of the Alberta Price Indices.\"  The inclusion of EnronOnline data satisfies the principal claims made by  Enron in their legal action against NGX, Canadian Enerdata Ltd., OM and  Richard Zarzeczny and Enron has agreed to discontinue the legal action  against those parties with the conclusion of this arrangement.\nNGX and Enron are planning to implement the necessary system changes by  August 1, 2001 but in any event will provide at least thirty days notice to  the industry.\nOnce in operation, data from transactions in the relevant  contracts listed on EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time.\nThe  methodology for computing the Alberta Gas Price Indices will continue to be  on a weighted-average basis.\nNGX will engage independent auditors to insure full compliance with the Index  Methodology Guide.\nThis guide is available on NGX's website at www.ngx.com.\nNGX located in Calgary, Canada provides electronic trading and clearing  services to natural gas buyers and sellers at seven markets in Canada.\nOver  the past six years, NGX has grown to serve over 120 customers with trading  activity averaging 225,000 TJ's per month.\nNGX is owned 100% by OM  (www.om.com).\nOM is a leader in providing products and services in the field of transaction  technology.\nThe company, with assets exceeding CDN $700 million, operates  exchanges in Calgary, London and Stockholm and develops technology that  increases the efficiency of financial and energy markets throughout the  world.\nOM is listed on Stockholmsborsen (ticker symbol \"OM\").\nEnron Corp. is one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas and  communications companies.\nThe company, with revenues of U.S. $101 billion in  2000, markets electricity and natural gas, delivers physical commodities and  financial risk management services to customers around the world, and has  developed an intelligent network platform to facilitate online business.\nFortune magazine has named Enron \"America's Most Innovative Company\" for six  consecutive years.\nEnron's Internet address is www.enron.com.\nThe stock is  traded under the ticker symbol \"ENE\".\nCanadian Enerdata Ltd.

(ENE) pulls out of the $3.5  billion Dolphin gas project, in which the company holds a 24.5% stake, the  U.A.E. Offsets Group, or UOG, will consider other companies to replace it, a  United Arab Emirates industry source close to the project said Tuesday.\nIndustry sources Monday said Enron is considering withdrawing from the  project because it doesn't believe it will be profitable.\nDolphin, an agreement signed two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, plans  to bring 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore  North Field to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai.\nEnron and TotalFinaElf (TOT) each hold a 24.5% stake in the project, while  UOG owns the remaining 51%.\nEnron is set to focus on the midstream part of the project - gas  transportation - which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a  processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi  and the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai.\nThe U.A.E. source said originally, it was thought that the U.A.E. government  would fund the pipeline, which is estimated to cost around $1 billion.\nHowever, more recently, the source said the U.A.E. suggested that Enron put  up the money itself.\nOther industry sources said Enron and TotalFinaElf also had to pay  significant fees to join the project.\nTotalFinaElf will operate the upstream part of the project, which includes developing natural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field.\nFirst wells are  scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in  2005.\nLast week, the Middle East Economic Survey reported that the foreign partners  haven't yet agreed on the precise details of their working relationship or on  the price of the pipeline.\nQatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of UOG, signed an  initial agreement in March for the upstream section of the project.\nA full  agreement is expected to be concluded in September, the source said.\n-By Dyala Sabbagh, Dow Jones Newswires; 9714 331 4260;  dyala.sabbagh@dowjones.com  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nEnron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2) 2001-05-15 16:35 (New York)  Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)       (Updates with closing share prices.)       Washington, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. should sell Portland General Electric Co. to Oregon so state consumers can be insulated from soaring electricity prices, a congressman said.\n\"Purchasing PGE would give Oregon ratepayers more control by keeping its assets in Oregon, accountable solely to Oregonians,\" U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Springfield, Oregon, said in a letter to Governor John Kitzhaber.\nThe governor is considering DeFazio's proposal, said Kitzhaber spokesman Kevin Smith.\nLast month, Houston-based Enron, the biggest energy trader, agreed to cancel the $3.1 billion sale of Portland General, a utility with more than 700,000 Oregon customers, to Sierra Pacific Resources of Reno, Nevada.\nEnron and Sierra Pacific blamed laws spawned by high power prices and electricity shortages in the West for the sale's collapse.\n\"We are pleased to keep Portland General in our asset portfolio because it's a solid earnings performer,\" Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said.\n\"If approached by a buyer who recognizes its value, we'd consider selling it.\"\nShe declined to comment on a potential bid by Oregon.\nThe state should act swiftly, DeFazio said, citing press reports that the U.K.'s Scottish Power Plc, owner of PacifiCorp, the largest utility in the U.S Northwest, may bid for Portland General.\nScottish Power, based in Glasgow, Scotland, would have more than 70 percent of Oregon electricity customers if it added Portland General, raising \"serious regulatory concerns about market power,\" he said.\nBond Issue       Oregon could issue bonds to purchase Portland General, using the utility's profits to pay the debt, DeFazio said.\nThe state might run it as a public utility or a cooperative, he said.\nEnron and Sierra Pacific called off the Portland General sale because of laws passed by Nevada and California legislators that slow the deregulation of their wholesale power markets.\nCalifornia and Nevada have blocked sales of power plants by utilities.\nSierra Pacific had to sell a stake in a Nevada power plant that sells power to California to win regulatory approval of the Portland General purchase.\nAverage power prices on the California-Oregon border this year have soared ninefold to $296.34 a megawatt hour over the year- earlier period.\nA megawatt hour can light 750 average California homes for an hour.\nShares of Enron fell $1.76 to $$56.99.\nThey've fallen 31 percent this year.\nSierra Pacific rose 9 cents to $16.09.\nScottish Power rose 9 pence to 492 ($7) in London.\nEnron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1) 2001-05-15 16:26 (New York)  Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)       (Adds closing share price.)       Houston, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's biggest energy trader, agreed to provide natural-gas pricing information to NGX Canada Inc. and drop a C$100 million ($64.7 million) suit against the Canadian gas exchange.\nEnron sued NGX in November after the Internet exchange, a unit of the company that owns the Stockholm Stock Exchange, changed providers of its gas-pricing data and didn't include trades on EnronOnline, Enron's Internet exchange, when calculating gas-price indexes.\nCalgary-based NGX agreed to include EnronOnline trades in calculating its Alberta Gas Price Indices by August, Enron spokesman Eric Thode said.\nNGX, owned by Stockholm's OM Gruppen AB, is used by about 90 percent of Canadian gas traders, and many traders use EnronOnline to sell gas from western Canada, the biggest supplier of the cleaner-burning fuel to the U.S.      Houston-based Enron fell $1.76 to $56.99."}

Energy giant Enron Corp. said on Tuesday it is reviewing strategic options for its loss-making broadband telecommunications business, which could involve selling the business or finding a partner.\n\"In addition to us looking at our business on a standalone business, we clearly have entertained some discussions on other possibilities,\" Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay told Reuters in a telephone interview.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Enron reported that one-time charges of $1.01 billion for broadband and other businesses outside its core energy operations pushed the company to a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, its first quarterly loss in more than four years.\nFuture options for the broadband business include \"sale, partnership, all kinds of possibilities\" he said.\n\"We still think over time that it will be a valuable business,\" Lay said, but for now the broadband market is in a \"total meltdown\", he added.\nEnron's broadband unit, which owns an 18,000 mile network, posted a loss of $80 million for the third quarter, but Lay said losses should be smaller in subsequent quarters.\nEnron launched its broadband business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential and has scaled down its operations.\nEnron's stock rose by 87 percent last year, driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of the EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform.\nBut the stock has fallen some 59 percent so far this year as sentiment toward the broadband project soured, CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after only six months in the job and wrangling continued over Enron's stalled Dabhol power plan project in India.\nEnron shares on Tuesday closed up 67 cents, or 2.02 percent, at $33.84.\nCopyright ?\n2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nUSA: UPDATE 6-Enron posts loss after taking $1 bln in charges.\nBy C. Bryson Hull  10/16/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.\nWASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. on Tuesday reported its first loss in more than four years after taking $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments, including water and telecommunications services, which it said have clouded the strength of its core energy businesses.\nEnron, North America's biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power, said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company's stock lost two-thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company.\n\"What we've tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way,\" Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay said in a conference call.\nLay reassumed the CEO mantle at Enron after his successor, Jeff Skilling, resigned in August after only six months at the helm.\nHouston-based Enron reported a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, or 84 cents a share, compared with net income of $271 million, or 34 cents a share, in the same period of 2000.\nIt was Enron's first loss since the second quarter of 1997.\nThe charges covered the company's loss-making broadband telecommunications business, its troubled water affiliate Azurix, and New Power Co., Enron's retail electricity joint-venture with AOL/Time Warner and IBM.\nCommerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade said it would probably take Enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a Wall Street favorite just 12 months ago.\n\"They do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting, they're a solid company, but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield,\" said Meade.\nEnron's stock closed 67 cents higher at $33.84 on Tuesday, but for the year it is down about 59 percent, underperforming the Standard & Poor's utilities index .\nSPU), which has fallen some 23 percent over the same period.\nILL-FATED BUSINESSES  Originally a natural gas pipeline operator, Enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of U.S. energy markets to become the nation's dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity.\nThe company moved into the water services business in 1998 by acquiring Britain's Wessex Water and forming Azurix, a unit which Enron took public in 1999 but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled.\nEnron helped set up New Power Co. and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about $28 per share to less than $2 as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated U.S. residential electricity markets.\nEnron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential.\nEnron's stock soared past sector peers last year when it posted a gain of 87 percent, driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform.\nBut the stock has fallen sharply this year as broadband sentiment soured, Skilling resigned and wrangling continued over Enron's stalled Dabhol power plan project in India.\nEnron's third-quarter earnings before one-time charges rose to $393 million, or 43 cents a share, from $292 million, or 34 cents a share, meeting analysts' expectations of 42 to 45 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.\nThe company reaffirmed its previously stated earnings targets of 45 cents a share for the fourth quarter, $1.80 for all of 2001 and $2.15 for all of 2002.\nDEBT ON CREDIT REVIEW  Rating agency Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday said it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade.\nThe writedowns would reduce Enron's equity base, increase its nominal financial leverage and materially impact its earnings, Moody's said.\nEnron's third-quarter earnings report showed that income at its wholesale marketing and trading division, the company's backbone moneymaker, grew 28 percent.\nThe division, which deals primarily in electricity and natural gas, saw pretax income rise to $754 million from $589 million in the third quarter of 2000.\nAll of the income growth in the segment came from Enron's gas and power trading and marketing operations in the Americas, where income grew to $701 million from $536 million last year.\nThe European segment, which includes gas and power operations there and other commodity sales like metals, coal and crude oil, remained flat at $53 million amid lower volatility.\nThe latest earnings report marked the first time that Enron has provided a financial breakdown of the European and Americas wholesale operations.\nIn doing so, Lay delivered on a promise he made after Skilling's departure: that he would make Enron's financial reporting more transparent.\nMany analysts and investors had grumbled about a lack of clarity from Enron.\nCopyright ?\n2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nEnron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9) 2001-10-16 16:29 (New York)  Enron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)       (Adds in sixth paragraph that losses are equal to 70 percent of Enron's profits over the last four quarters. Closes shares.)       Houston, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, had a $618 million loss in the third quarter after expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales cost the company $1.01 billion.\nThe loss was 84 cents a share after payment of preferred dividends, Enron said.\nNet income a year earlier was $292 million, or 34 cents.\nRevenue rose 59 percent to $47.6 billion.\nInvestors have sent Enron stock down 60 percent this year on concern about investments outside energy trading and natural-gas pipelines.\nSome investors praised Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive officer, for acknowledging the failure of the new businesses.\nOthers said they're not confident all the bad news is out.\n\"What is disconcerting is that they didn't do this sooner,\" said Donald Coxe, manager of the $352 million Harris Insight Equity Fund.\n\"If you kill one cockroach in the kitchen, it doesn't mean there aren't more.\"       Investors have questioned Enron's financial reporting in the past year, especially after Jeffrey Skilling's resignation as CEO in August.\nSkilling, who helped Lay transform Enron from a gas- pipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading, said he left for personal reasons.\nInvestors said they weren't confident Enron was detailing all its problems.\nFailed Businesses       The $1.01 billion in losses, which total $1.11 a share, are equal to 70 percent of Enron's $1.45 billion in profits over the past four quarters.\nIncluded were $544 million for losses on investments in New Power Co., a venture formed with AOL Time Warner Inc. and International Business Machines Corp.\nNew Power competes for energy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power and gas suppliers as they do long-distance phone companies.\nThe $544 million also includes losses from the Enron unit that trades space, known as bandwidth, on fiber-optic networks, as well as for the \"early termination of certain structured finance arrangements\" with an undisclosed \"entity.\"\nEnron wouldn't be more specific.\nEnron said restructuring the fiber-optic unit would cost another $180 million, including severance pay to 500 fired workers.\nThe business collapsed this year along with the fortunes of the dot-com companies that were expected to be some off its biggest customers.\nThe declining value of assets owned by Azurix Corp., its water and sewage treatment business, will cost $287 million, Enron said.\nEnron might take a first-quarter \"adjustment\" of less than $200 million because of accounting changes related to goodwill, Lay said in an interview.\n\"If we thought there were any other significant concerns, we would have taken care of them today,\" Lay said.\nExcluding Losses       Minus the losses, Enron would have earned $393 million, or 43 cents a share, up 35 percent from the year-earlier period.\nThat matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.\nEnron has averaged quarterly profit increases of 31 percent for the past year.\nIts wholesale services business, which includes energy trading, had income before interest, minority interests and taxes of $754 million, up 28 percent from a year earlier.\nShares of Enron rose 67 cents to $33.84.\nEarlier, the stock had risen as much as 5.2 percent to $34.90.\n\"There's a sigh of relief that Enron's core businesses, its energy merchant businesses, are OK,\" said Roger Hamilton, who helps manage John Hancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares.\nEnron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the fourth quarter, $1.80 for the full year and $2.15 in 2002.\n'Ridiculous Investments'       At one time, Enron pinned high hopes on the businesses that contributed to the $1.01 billion in losses.\nEnron spent $2.8 billion in 1998 for the U.K.'s Wessex Water, from which Azurix emerged.\nEnron sold shares to the public in 1999, and then bought back the company this year after Azurix failed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winning large projects.\nIn August, Enron agreed to sell Azurix's North American business to American Water Works Inc. for $150 million.\nIn February 2000, Lay said trading bandwidth could become the company's fastest-growing business.\nIn the latest quarter, the bandwidth unit's loss before interest, minority interests and taxes widened to $80 million from $20 million a year earlier.\nRevenue plunged to $4 million from $162 million.\n\"You can make the case that Jeff Skilling leaving was for the best,\" John Hancock's Hamilton said.\n\"Under him, they built the best trading operation while also making all these ridiculous investments.\"       While admitting its poor choices, Enron also supplied more information this quarter about how it makes money.\nThe company gave results of individual commodity-trading desks, including coal, forest products and steel.\n\"I liked that they broke out the different commodities,\" Hamilton said.\n\"I think Lay has gotten the message loud and clear, and that the effort is there.\""}

(ENE) is looking to cut its workforce in Europe by up to 10%, or around 500 jobs, Enron Europe Chief Executive John Sherriff said Thursday.\n\"We have around 5,000 employees in Europe and we are seeking to cut our headcount here by between 5% and 10%, but we will aim as far as possible to achieve this through a program of voluntary severance,\" Sherriff replied in a written response to questions by Dow Jones Newswires.\nThe cuts are the first significant retrenchment by Enron since it arrived in Europe in 1989.\nEnron has been the most aggressive U.S. energy company to expand into Europe's deregulating markets, but its core energy trading businesses have been held back by the slow and piecemeal progress toward market liberalization in the E.U.  The company declined to be more specific about how far it will scale back individual product lines or coverage of certain geographical businesses.\nEnron's product range in Europe has mushroomed over the past year, continually giving rise to market talk, notably among its competitors, of overstretching itself prematurely in underdeveloped markets.\n\"Enron's business continues to grow in Europe in terms of traded volumes and numbers of transactions, but like any company we are constantly seeking ways to do more with less in order to maintain earnings growth,\" Sherriff said.\n\"It is prudent for us to keep both a close eye on our costs and to continually review the skills and resources that are available to use, to ensure that they are deployed in a way to maximize earnings,\" he added.\nWhile trading volumes have exploded in core markets such as U.K. power trading since wholesale market reforms were introduced in March, liquidity in other products such as bandwidth, monomers and credit risk, is understood to have developed more slowly and restricted the volume growth needed to justify Enron's pure trading strategy.\nEnron has been among the most prominent exponents of a new philosophy in energy markets that places far more emphasis on risk management skills than the physical ownership of assets, a radical change from the asset-heavy approach to energy that prevailed in Europe before the E.U.'s deregulation directive came into effect in 1999.\nAs such, it has in the last 18 months disposed of assets such as its stake in Sutton Bridge power station in England and has conspicuously refrained from buying 'brownfield' physical assets in markets such as Italy and Germany.\nHowever, it has pursued various greenfield independent power projects and the acquisition of gas trading licenses in markets such as Spain and Italy.\n-By Geoffrey T.

(EXC).\nSelect Energy announced an agreement Tuesday to purchase the wholesale and retail energy sales unit of Syracuse, New York-based Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc. (NMK), which is active in the Mid-Atlantic and New York power markets.\nIntegration plans aren't firm, but Select Energy will work with Niagara Mohawk executives to identify best practices from both companies, Schivley said.\nThe companies aim to have a transition plan ready by the time federal energy regulators rule on the combination.\nSelect Energy has said it plans to keep Niagara Mohawk's Syracuse office open.\nThe company won't release the terms of the deal until it closes, which is expected in late November.\nSelect has annual revenues of about $2.5 billion.\nNiagara Mohawk Energy Marketing had revenues of $635 million in 2000.\nSelect Energy is still looking at further acquisitions of trading operation and generating assets in New York and the Mid-Atlantic, Schivley said.\n\"This is more than just window shopping,\" Schivley said.\n\"We are actively seeking out hard assets.\"  The company isn't interested, however, in the two other unregulated units Niagara Mohawk is looking to sell in advance of its acquisition by National Grid Group PLC (NGG), he added.\nWithin the next three to five years, more and more large companies are likely to start outsourcing management of their energy needs, especially as those needs become more complicated, Schivley said.\nEnergy, along with labor and raw materials, are companies' three biggest expenses, he said.\n\"We're trying to grow this business by leaps and bounds,\" Schivley said.\n\"We've taken a giant step in New York.

(ENE) without assessing the costs and regardless of \"what it does for local reliability.\"  DeFazio's complaints were echoed in the testimony presented at Wednesday's hearing.\nThe region already enjoys an open and competitive transmission network, thanks to the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration, according to hearing testimony expressing concern that RTO West, as the RTO proposed for the region is called, will cost more to implement than it will provide in benefits.\n\"We are troubled that RTO West will not achieve any net benefit for end-use consumers in the Northwest,\" the Public Power Council testified.\n\"Although work is beginning on a cost-benefit study, we are troubled that a transmission system that has served us all well for so long will be disassembled because FERC has announced that RTOs, by definition, are good.\"  \"Regional transmission organizations may be necessary to remedy the transmission ills in other regions of the country, but not in the Northwest,\" declared a group of transmission-dependent utilities.\n\"The 'balkanization' and isolation of transmission systems that characterize most other regions is simply not present in the Northwest. For this reason, the economic power-side benefits of an RTO will be relatively small,\" said a group of aluminum producers.\nSimilar cost-benefit concerns have been voiced by state utility regulators in the Eastern U.S. who oppose FERC's effort to consolidate grid assets under large RTOs in the Southeast and Northeast.\n'RTO Week'   FERC Chairman Pat Wood III acknowledged the complaints Thursday, adding that he expected to address the concerns of regulators and industry during \"RTO Week\" Oct. 15, when the commission will hold five days of hearings on the commission's RTO mandate.\n\"I think I need the decisionmakers at the table. We've had the lawyers in the suits arguing about it for eight years now,\" Wood said at an \"energy community\" forum sponsored by Enron in Arlington, Va.\nWood told Dow Jones Newswires following his remarks at the Enron forum that FERC answered the complaints about the lack of a cost-benefit analysis at its Sept. 26 meeting.\nThe commission agreed to undertake a comprehensive analysis in support of its claim that RTOs will bring about operational efficiencies that will translate into consumer savings.\nWood also noted a study by Mirant Corp. (MIR), which concluded that combining the three independent system operators in the Northeast into a single RTO would produce $440 million in annual consumer benefits.\nDuring the Enron forum, Edward Meyers, a regulator with the District of Columbia Public Service Commission, urged Wood to seek out the input of affected state regulators.\nMeyers noted that he is in the minority among regulators in the region in supporting the Northeast RTO grid-consolidation, while most others oppose the effort as \"economically dangerous.\"  Arnetta McRae, chairman of the Delaware Public Service Commission, told Wood that her fellow state regulators aren't so much opposed to grid regionalization but the lack of consultation by FERC.\nThe state regulators want \"an opportunity to be at the table,\" McRae said.\nIf such a process were offered, there would be a lot less opposition, she predicted.\nFERC is reaching out to address the concerns of state regulators, Wood said, adding that he was \"blindsided\" by the opposition among state regulators to FERC's grid-consolidation mandate.\nLater in the day, Wood told reporters that \"RTO Week\" will feature an entire hearing devoted to the concerns of state regulators.\nAt the Enron forum, Wood defended the commission's RTO policy, which calls for carving up the nation's interconnected electricity system under the control of four or five large RTOs, as necessary to jump-start the overly long transition from regulation to competition.\n\"This process needs to be goosed,\" said Wood, calling FERC's RTO orders \"an external catalyst\" to get the process moving.\n\"If I'm wrong, I'd love to find a better way around that,\" he said.\n-By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647; Bryan.Lee@dowjones.com  Copyright ?\n2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nUSA: NewPower signs up 50,000 new electric users in Texas.\n10/04/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.\nNEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The New Power Co. said Thursday the electricity grid operator in Texas is processing requests from over 50,000 residential customers who have chosen New Power as their new electricity provider.\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) is responsible for processing the requests to switch customers for all utilities and competitive retail electric service providers during the state's deregulation pilot program, NewPower said in a statement.\nThe switching process could take anywhere from two weeks to two months before consumers will actually begin to receive power from a competitive retail electricity provider.\nNew Power said it has captured more than half of the customers who decided to switch to new providers from the Reliant Energy HL&P and TXU Corp. markets.\nThe New Power Co., a subsidiary of NewPower Holdings, Inc.\n, is the first national provider of electricity and natural gas to residential and small commercial customers in deregulated power markets in the United States.\nThe Texas pilot power deregulation program began on July 31 after it was delayed two months due to computer problems.\nThe entire state is slated to begin full retail competition on Jan. 1, 2002.\nA spokesman for the Public Utility Commission of Texas told Reuters previously that about 120,000 residential customers had signed up for the pilot program.\nCopyright ?\n2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nStates protest federal involvement in electricity competition, deregulation By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer  10/04/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001.\nThe Associated Press.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nWASHINGTON (AP) - North Carolina and several other states told the Supreme Court the government went too far when it ordered electric utilities to open their power lines to competitors and spurred a movement toward deregulation.\nBut one of the country's largest power marketers, Enron, argued before the court Wednesday that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should have gone even further to help companies like Enron get equal access to power grids.\nDuring the hourlong hearing, the justices gave little indication of how they will decide on a case that could dramatically affect management of the nation's power grids and the future of electricity competition.\nAt one point, Justice Stephen Breyer said FERC, which regulates wholesale power markets and interstate transmission of power, was being \"whipsawed\" from both directions.\nThe commission's 1996 decision, which for the first time required traditional utilities to open their transmission lines to competing power merchants, triggered a movement toward wholesale electricity competition and led numerous states to end monopolies in retail power markets.\nBut utility regulators in nine states, led by New York, filed suit arguing that the FERC order amounts to a federal agency attempting to regulate retail sales, usurping a traditional state function.\nAt the same time, Enron's lawsuit charged that FERC violated federal law because it did not require access to transmission lines when utilities continued to keep transmission and retail sales as one operation - as remains the case in many states that have yet to allow competition.\nIn June 2000, an appellate court essentially upheld FERC's regulation, prompting appeals from both Enron and the state regulators.\n\"It's an example of where an agency has overstepped its bounds,\" Lawrence Malone, general counsel for the New York State Public Service Commission, told the justices at Wednesday's hearing.\nThe other states party to the lawsuit are Florida, Idaho, New Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia, Washington, Vermont and Wyoming.\nMalone, appearing on behalf of all nine states, argued that FERC's order pre-empts state authority to regulate retail sales and set rates.\n\"This case isn't about rates,\" countered Louis Cohen, representing Enron Power Marketing Inc. before the court.\n\"What we're concerned about is getting onto the (grid) system.\"  Cohen said that under the current access rules a dominant utility in a state that has not moved to competition may still \"hog\" the lines and keep Enron and similar marketers from moving power across a region.\nThe Justice Department, representing FERC before the court, argued that the commission only sought to strike a balance between the need to give competitors equal access to power lines and leaving retail market issues to the states.\nEdwin Kneedler, deputy solicitor general, told the court that FERC, in his view, could have gone further, as Enron has argued.\nBut, he said, to do so it would first have had to order all utilities to separate retail sales and transmission, something it chose to leave to the states.\nThe case, which is not expected to be decided until sometime next year, comes at a time of growing concern about electricity competition and power grid reliability in light of recent power problems in California.\nAbout half of the states have taken some steps toward retail electricity competition.\nMany power industry experts as well as the FERC commissioners have emphasized that a truly competitive electricity market will be difficult to achieve without smooth and efficient flow of electricity across large regions, if not nationally.\nAnd that, argue companies like Enron who want to compete with traditional utilities, will require more open access to transmission.\nIn an attempt to smooth the flow of power, FERC has embarked on a campaign to establish four large, regional transmission organizations to manage the national power grid.\nA court decision rolling back some of FERC's authority over open access to transmission lines could affect that effort.\nUncertainty over how far the federal government will be allowed to go in requiring transmission access also could affect state decisions on whether to embrace electricity competition, according to some industry experts.\n---  On the Net:  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission: http://www.ferc.fed.us/  Enron: http://www.enron.com/corp/  Copyright ?\n2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved."}

Gray Davis prepared to address the st= ate=20 Thursday night on energy, economic forecasters predicted his constitutents= =20 will pay higher taxes, watch out-of-state investments evaporate and suffer= =20 scrapped public projects because of the ongoing power crisis.\n=20 The UCLA Anderson Forecast says the worst economic threat could come from= =20 state government itself and its scrutiny of private power suppliers, which= =20 along with blackouts and brownouts, could scare new businesses away.\n=20 Davis addressed some commercial concerns Wednesday by breaking with his=20 appointees on the Public Utilities Commission by saying private companies a= nd=20 other large power users should be allowed to contract directly for power wi= th=20 generators.\n=20         State gets $4.1 billion infusion=20 All California hospitals exempted from blackouts=20 Quick fix proposed for power problems=20 Continuing coverage: California's Power Crisis=20 ?\n=20    Critics of allowing direct access include PUC President Loretta Lynch and T= he=20 Utility Reform Network, who say residential customers and small businesses= =20 unable to garner such contracts will get stuck with the bill for the billio= ns=20 of dollars the state has and will spend buying electricity for the customer= s=20 of three cash-strapped utilities.\n=20 Word came from California's treasurer Wednesday that the state had secured= =20 $4.1 billion in loans to help pay back the state's power buys.\n=20 Facing continued refusal from federal energy regulators to cap high energy= =20 prices, Davis reassessed the tools at his disposal Wednesday, saying he is= =20 open to supporting a windfall-profits tax being proposed by lawmakers on=20 electric generators that have made a fortune selling power to California th= is=20 year.\n=20 Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett, D-San Leandro, introduced a windfall-profits t= ax=20 bill Wednesday that would tax gross receipts that \"significantly exceed\" th= e=20 cost of producing power.\n=20 It would also tax profits of power marketers who have bought power and late= r=20 sold it at much higher rates.\nThe rate of the tax was not specified in the= =20 bill, and Corbett said she expects the details to be worked out later.\n=20 \"We continue to allow some electricity generators and middlemen to reap=20 enormous profits on their sales of electricity into the state. This=20 profiteering must stop,\" said Corbett.\n=20 Senators on the Revenue and Tax Committee have also inserted similar langua= ge=20 into a pending bill.\n=20 Tom Williams, spokesman for Duke Energy, said he doubted a tax on a selecte= d=20 industry would be legal.\nThe tax would discourage generators from building= =20 new power plants in California, he said.\n=20 \"The governor has made very clear that he is trying to do whatever he can t= o=20 increase the amount of generation in California and reduce the price.=20 Windfall profits taxes do neither of these,\" said Williams.\n=20 \"Clearly it would have an adverse affect on our decisions on new investment= =20 or following through on our planned investments,\" he said.\n=20 Davis said Wednesday he generally opposes treating profitable companies in= =20 that manner, \"but these profits are outrageous and are at our expense. The= =20 only things companies understand is leverage. I'm not saying I'll sign it a= nd=20 I'm not saying I won't sign it.\"=20 For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy thei= r=20 power from generators instead of going through the utilities.\n=20 A January law that allowed the state to begin buying power for two nearly= =20 bankrupt utilities barred such side contracts.\n=20 \"That was done originally with the thought the state would have more power= =20 and no one to sell it to if companies got off the grid,\" Davis said.\n\"But o= ur=20 problem is the opposite this summer. If companies want to get off the grid,= =20 we should encourage, not discourage that.\"=20 The Democratic governor's comments came after he met behind closed doors fo= r=20 more than two hours with Assembly Republicans, who have sharply criticized= =20 his handling of the energy crisis.\n=20 \"I think everyone agreed there are no political winners unless we resolve= =20 this challenge,\" Davis said.\n\"There were a lot of suggestions in there I'm= =20 willing to adopt.\"=20 For instance, he agreed that San Diego Gas and Electric customers should ha= ve=20 a different benchmark for receiving 20 percent rebates under his program fo= r=20 consumers who cut their energy use by 20 percent this summer.\n=20 Unlike other Californians, San Diego residents faced soaring rates last=20 summer and began conserving then, so Davis said they should have to cut 20= =20 percent from 1999 energy use levels instead of using last summer as a=20 starting point.\n=20 Davis said he hasn't written the remarks he will make during a five-minute= =20 address at 6:05 p.m.\nThursday that he has asked California television=20 stations to carry live.\n=20 However, he said he will \"share with them (viewers) the progress that we've= =20 made and what we have to get through.\"=20 He is expected to talk about the more than 40 percent rate increases approv= ed=20 last week by the PUC for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and=20 Southern California Edison Co.\n=20  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- ----------------------------------------   State gets $4.1 billion infusion=20    Treasurer to Davis: Don't pay generators' 'ransom' By Ed Mendel=20 UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20 April 5, 2001=20 SACRAMENTO -- State Treasurer Phil Angelides announced an agreement for a= =20 $4.1 billion short-term loan yesterday that would provide urgently needed= =20 cash to begin repaying the state general fund for power purchases.\n=20 Angelides said the loan is needed to protect the state's credit rating and= =20 preserve \"important funding for programs such as education, public safety a= nd=20 children's services.\"=20 The treasurer also sent a letter to Gov. Gray Davis warning that plans to= =20 increase the size of a $10 billion bond, which would repay the short-term= =20 loan and finance future power purchases, may only delay the \"reality of=20 runaway energy prices.\"=20 Angelides urged Davis and the Legislature to send power generators a messag= e=20 by considering a windfall profits tax or seizure of power plants that=20 utilities sold under a failed deregulation plan.\n=20 \"These are very tough guys,\" Angelides said, \"and you don't negotiate with= =20 them by trying to figure out night and day how to pay their ransom.

(DYN) and Enron Corp. (ENE) will face a complicated and time-consuming regulatory-review process, legal experts said Thursday.\nAny equity deal would require approvals from numerous U.S. federal regulatory agencies and state utility regulators, as well as survive Canadian and European antitrust reviews, energy attorneys contacted by Dow Jones Newswires said.\nA merger would require approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission.\nAnd the Illinois Commerce Commission likely would weigh into the mix, since Dynegy owns Illinova's Illinois Power Co.\nAny effort to strike a deal quickly also could be complicated by Enron's ownership of Portland General Electric Co.\nWhile Enron has entered into an agreement to sell the utility to Northwest Natural Gas Co. (NWN), a previous attempt to sell the company fell through because of regulatory complications.\nA key issue for federal regulators scrutinizing a potential Enron-Dynegy merger will be the degree of electricity market concentration such a transaction would entail, the attorneys said.\nFinancially wounded Enron is the nation's largest electricity and natural gas trader with an extensive network of gas pipelines.\nDynegy is ranked sixth nationally in both electricity and natural gas marketing.\nThe transaction would receive the greatest scrutiny at FERC, where the merger application would challenge the commission's merger-review policy, attorneys said.\nCopyright ?\n2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nUS Physical Gas Prices Mostly Down;

(DYN) confirmed the neighboring rivals were talks for a potential \"business combination.\"\nAn agreement hasn't been reached yet, and neither company will make any further comment until a contract is signed or the talks end.\nSeparately, Enron restated its earnings from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001.\nAs the news hit the tape, Enron shares, after being briefly halted, seemed to hunt for a direction.\nThe stock traded as high as $10, and as low as $8.40.\nCurrently, the shares were at $8.67, down 38 cents, or 4.2%.\nWednesday, the shares zigzagged.\nMeanwhile, Dynegy shares, which had fallen Wednesday as news of the talks began to leak out, regained lost ground and then added some.\nDynegy shares were recently trading up $4.54, or 13.8%, at $37.54.\n\"There's a lot of news to digest,\" said Glen Hilton, a portfolio manager at San Francisco-based Montgomery Asset Management.\nEnron shares have been in a downward spiral since it revealed last month that the unwinding of off-balance sheet transaction with a partnership run by its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, had resulted in the loss of $1.2 billion in shareholder equity.\nThat bad news led to more bad news, including the downgrades of its credit ratings, which are essential to the health of its core wholesale energy marketing and trading business.\nMeanwhile, investor confidence eroded as market watchers asked Enron to come clean.\nThe move in Enron and Dynegy shares Thursday was unusual for companies considering a merger.\nTypically, shares of the acquirer will fall, while shares of the target climb.\nInvestors explained the move several ways.\nSome said it was a reflection of the lack of a premium Enron shareholders will be paid.\nTheir views were based on a report in The Wall Street Journal, which cited a source familiar with the matter who said Dynegy is considering paying $7 billion to $8 billion in stock, or about one-tenth of what Enron was worth 15 months ago.\nOthers agreed, and said given recent events they're being cautious.\nLarry Alberts, a buy-side analyst at American Express Financial Advisors, said he was questioning how serious Dynegy is about the transaction.\nHe also said there is still the possibility of more bad news to come from Enron.\nAs for the restatement of earnings going back to 1997, investors said it was clearly having a negative impact on Enron's stock even though some had been expecting it.\nJohn Waterman, of Rittenhouse Financial Services, said the information Enron disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission was \"hard to sort through.\"  Waterman said he was encouraged that the restatement didn't reflect any revenue recognition issues, and it still showed that there was growth in the business - albeit not as much as previously reported.\nEnron had to restate the earnings because it should have included three of its off-balance sheet financing vehicles - Chewco Investments LP, Joint Energy Development Investments LP, or JEDI, and a unit of LJM Cayman LP - in its consolidated financial statements under the guidelines of generally accepted accounting principles.\nRevelations about the involvement of Enron's Fastow in LJM are at the center of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and led to demands from the financial community that he be terminated.\nOn Wednesday, Enron disclosed it has fired its treasurer, Ben Glisan, and its general counsel, Kristina Mordaunt, as well.\nGilsan, Mordaunt, and two former Enron employees were partners of LJM while serving at Enron.\nEnron continues to say it had controls in place relating to Fastow's involvement with the partnerships.\nThe board required review and approval of each transaction by the office of the chairman, the chief accounting officer and the chief risk officer.\nWhether these controls and procedures were followed will be investigated by a special committee Enron has named.\nMany expect that if Enron remains independent, more executive departures could be in store.\n\"The bottom line from my perspective is that Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, and the board seemed to be aware (of Fastow's dealings with the LJM partnerships),\" said Andre Meade, an analyst at Commerzebanc Securities.\n\"Everyone's hands are dirty, including Ken Lay. ... The firing the CFO and treasurer are not going to single-handedly solve the problems at Enron,\" he continued.\nOthers also are questioning the role of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditor.\n\"People like us have to rely on people like them,\" said Rittenhouse's Waterman.\nAccording to its restated financial information, Enron had close to $13 billion in debt at Sept. 30.\nLiquidity issues remain the chief concern among investors, who continue to fret that the latest disclosure will result in a further deterioration of Enron's credit rating.\n\"The clock is ticking on Enron,\" said Montgomery's Hilton.\n\"Each day brings a new piece of incremental news.\"  Following the release of Enron's earnings last month, Hilton had a hunch the company would likely write off additional investments as it had in the third quarter.\nHowever, he was committed to the stock, and at the time he didn't plan to sell his stake, which accounted for 2% of the close to $100 million in assets he manages.\nSince that time, Hilton has sold his Enron stock.\nHe said he began selling after news of the SEC probe broke.\n\"It just got too scary to hold,\" he said.\nStill, Hilton, who owns shares of Dynegy as well, isn't concerned about the possibility of a merger of the two Houston energy traders.\n\"It's David taking Goliath,\" he said, adding that he is convinced that Dynegy's management will not enter into a transaction that will threaten the company's stability.\nSeveral Dynegy investors echoed Hilton's sentiment with their own expressions of confidence in Dynegy's management.\nHowever, at times these convictions were almost betrayed by a nervousness brought on by the sense that what one doesn't know could be hurtful.\nSome investors remain concerned by Dynegy's motivation.\nAccording to Hilton, investors don't know what would happen to the market -

Utility holding company FirstEnergy Corp. sold $4 billion of five-, 10-and 30-year debt on Thursday, helped by investors' preference for defensive sectors as the U.S. economy stalls.\nFirstEnergy was able to lower its borrowing costs, trimming yields from initial indications.\nThe sale originally was expected to offer generous yields as heavy bond issuance, weak wholesale power prices and investor jitters over the troubles of energy trading firm Enron Corp. weighed on the utility sector.\nAkron, Ohio-based FirstEnergy will use proceeds for corporate purposes and to help pay for its recent purchase of Morristown, New Jersey-based GPU Inc.\n.\nFirstEnergy purchased GPU for about $4.5 billion in cash and stock, plus the assumption of about $7.2 billion in debt.\nThe sale closed on Tuesday.\nUtility bonds are typically viewed as a conservative investments because of the industry's stable income during uncertain economic times.\nThe sector has been under a cloud, though, as Houston-based Enron has struggled with a cash squeeze and writedowns from off-balance-sheet transactions.\n\"Enron was held up as a model, growing extremely quickly, and the recent financial disclosures are just a shock,\" said Kelly Perl, a project director at New York utility consulting firm Applied Economic Research.\nSpreads, or the yield gaps between utility bonds and U.S. Treasuries, have widened about 0.15 to 0.20 percentage point over the past two weeks, while spreads on gas and pipeline companies have widened about 0.30 percentage points, strategists said.\nSALE TERMS  FirstEnergy sold $1 billion of 5.5 percent five-year notes at 99.888 cents on the dollar, yielding 5.526 percent or 1.98 percentage points more than similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries.\nIt also sold $1.5 billion of 6.45 percent 10-year notes at 99.651 cents on the dollar, yielding 6.498 percent or 2.25 percentage points more than Treasuries, and $1.5 billion of 7.375 percent 30-year bonds, yielding 7.389 percent or 2.45 percentage points more than the old long Treasury bond.\nInitial price guidance had called for spreads as high as 2.20, 2.35 and 2.60 percentage points more than Treasuries for the five-, 10-and 30-year debt.\nFirstEnergy's sale was helped by a 0.50 percentage point interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday and signs that the Fed could cut rates again.\n\"There is the perception that the Fed is going to aggressively ease and err on the side of caution,\" said Peter Palfrey, portfolio manager for Loomis Sayles & Co. in Boston.\nInvestors are betting that the Fed will engineer an economic recovery, helping corporate profits and spurring price gains in corporate bonds, Palfrey said.\nAnalysts said FirstEnergy's acquisition of GPU should benefit its credit quality.\n\"It adds further diversity to their cash flow from regulated distribution companies,\" said Fitch analyst Robert Hornick.\nFalling wholesale power prices also should benefit FirstEnergy, Hornick said.\n\"They're not a big seller of wholesale energy at this point,\" Hornick said.\n\"They don't own generation facilities and need to buy (electricity) in the market, so to the extent wholesale prices are lower, they can benefit,\" he said.\nStandard & Poor's rates FirstEnergy's senior unsecured notes \"BBB-minus,\" its lowest investment grade.\nMoody's Investors Service rates FirstEnergy's long-term debt \"Baa2,\" roughly one notch higher, while Fitch rates them \"BBB.\"  Salomon Smith Barney, Barclays Capital and Morgan Stanley arranged the sale.\nCopyright ?\n2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nUSA: WRAPUP 1-Enron, Dynegy confirm possible merger talks.\nBy Jeff Franks  11/08/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.\nHOUSTON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., plagued by investor doubts and under the gun to shore up its crumbling finances, said on Thursday it was talking with power trading rival Dynegy Inc. about a possible merger.\nThe company, whose stock and credit ratings have plummeted amid an uproar about questionable business transactions, admitted it made bookkeeping errors and restated earnings for the last four years.\nIt also said former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who abruptly left the company last month, had made $30 million managing partnerships linked to the deals.\nThe deals, which were off the balance sheet, are now under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for possible conflict of interest.\nTwo other executives, managing director and treasurer Ben Glisan and Enron division general counsel Kristina Mordaunt, were both believed to have links to the Fastow-led partnerships and have been fired, the company disclosed.\nThe announcements threw a spotlight on Enron's stark situation, in which the nation's top energy trader has gone from Wall Street darling to pariah in a few weeks and now faces a cash crunch so dire it is seeking a merger with the much-smaller Dynegy.\nIts credit ratings have fallen to near-junk levels in recent weeks, making it difficult to get money to boost investor confidence and back the trading operations that provide 90 percent of Enron's income.\nThe company reportedly has been seeking investors to provide a cash infusion for an equity stake.\nMODERATE PREMIUM  Word about a possible Dynegy-Enron deal leaked out on Wednesday, and on Thursday the two companies confirmed talks about a possible \"business combination\" were underway, but said no agreement had been reached.\nSources told Reuters that the two Texas rivals, whose headquarters are a few blocks apart in downtown Houston, were talking about a stock swap with a moderate premium for shareholders and a $1.5 billion capital infusion from ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26.5 percent of Dynegy.\nThe stock swap is valued at about $8 billion, or about $10 a share, The New York Times reported on Thursday.\nA merger would catapult Dynegy to the top of the energy trading industry now dominated by Enron.\nLast year, the company had $29 billion in revenues, compared to $100 billion for Enron.\nFor Enron, it would cap an astonishingly rapid fall from grace.\nEnron stock has lost $19 billion in market value since its crisis began in mid-October and was down another 45 cents to $8.60 in Thursday trading.\nDynegy shares rose $3.87 to $36.87.\nEnron restated its earnings going back to 1997, saying its auditors advised that the off-the-balance sheet deals in question should have been included in the company's financial statements.\nThe restated results reduced Enron's net income by $591 million, or 22 percent, from 1997 to 2000, and increased its debt by $628 million, or 6 percent, after two of the partnership's financial statements were consolidated into Enron's earnings.\nEnron said the restatement reflects a $1.2 billion reduction to shareholders' equity that touched off the current controversy when the company offhandedly disclosed it last month.\nAngry shareholders suddenly worried that Enron was hiding other liabilities in its complex financial statements and began demanding more information.\nIn a statement, Enron chief executive Ken Lay said the company hoped it had allayed Wall Street fears with Thursday's announcements.\n\"We believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about these matters,\" he said.\nAnalysts, wary after last month's surprise revelations, said Enron may have more to release, but they were pleased it was finally coming forth with information.\n\"It's an attempt to come clean,\" said Raymond Moore, an analyst with Weatherly Securities.\nCopyright ?\n2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nIN THE MONEY: Enron Transparency Not Transparent Enough By Michael Rapoport  11/08/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\n) A Dow Jones Newswires Column   NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- So Enron Corp. (ENE) says it wants to be more transparent - to make its impenetrable financial results and corporate structure easier for investors and analysts to understand.\nBased on its announcements Thursday, however, it still has a heck of a long way to go.\nWith Enron's restatement Thursday of nearly five years' worth of earnings and additional information about the maze of off-balance-sheet deals related to it, we now have a lot more information about the mess at Enron than we had 24 hours ago.\nBut we're not much closer to understanding just what HAPPENED to leave Enron in such a mess - and that's because the company's explanations of all this continue to be dense, confusing and next to impossible to grasp.\nTry this tidbit, from the Form 8-K Enron filed about the restatements Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission:  \"In addition, Enron's net income is reduced for specific JEDI revenues previously allocated to Chewco, relating to the appreciation in value of Enron stock, which eliminate upon consolidation. This, in effect, reduces Enron's share of JEDI's earnings.\"  Huh?\nAnd no, it doesn't help you to know that \"Chewco\" is an entity that wasn't included in Enron's financial results but which Enron now admits should have been.\nOr that \"JEDI\" isn't a \"Star Wars\" reference but a limited partnership in which both Enron and Chewco had invested.\nIt's still impenetrable.\nThen there are the times when Enron just plain doesn't give enough information.\nThe company says its decision that Chewco should be included in its results after all \"is based on current information that Chewco did not meet the accounting criteria to qualify as ... unconsolidated...\"\nUh - okay.\nWHY didn't it meet the criteria, and why did Enron previously believe that it did?\nEnron doesn't say.\nFinally, Enron makes some assertions that just make you scratch your head.\nThe company says part of the restatement of its earnings stems from unspecified \"prior-year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications which were determined to be immaterial in the year originally proposed.\"  Hmmm.\nBeyond the fact that Enron doesn't elaborate on the nature of these \"audit adjustments and reclassifications,\" or why they were originally considered immaterial, consider that according to Enron's own figures in the 8-K, they add up to a negative earnings impact of $87 million since 1997.\nThat amount doesn't sound like any definition of \"immaterial\" I've ever heard.\nAn Enron spokesman couldn't immediately be reached for comment.\nIn fairness, this lack of clarity may be all but inevitable given Enron's Byzantine structure, which involves dealings with outside but related entities that also have third parties involved, which in one case have a subsidiary that allowed Enron to hedge the risks of an investment, and in another case is selling assets purchased from Enron to OTHER entities in order to finish paying Enron for the original transaction, and ... you get the idea.\nIt's next to impossible to make clear because Enron's structure is just too baroque to understand in the first place.\nThe market is plenty puzzled by all this, even in the wake of Enron's attempt to clarify things.\nTake a look at the company's drunken-sailor stock chart from Thursday.\nAfter news of the restatements hit, Enron stock first jumped higher, going as high as $10 a share, then soon dropped back, to as low as $8.40, as investors started to digest the details of the news.\nThen up again to about $9.25, then down again to its current level of around $8.50.\nThere's no reason investors should be confused like this.\nThere is absolutely no reason that a reasonably intelligent layman, with an elementary working knowledge of corporate finance, should be unable to understand the regulatory filings, structure, earnings and balance sheet of any public company.\nIf that happens, it's the company's fault, not the investor's - either because the company hasn't explained things well enough or because its structure is needlessly complicated to begin with.\nIf Enron wants to get back the market's confidence, fixing that problem, one way or the other, would be a good place to start.\n-By Michael Rapoport, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5976; michael.rapoport@dowjones.com    Copyright ?\n2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nS&P Lowers Rating on Yosemite Securities Trust I; On Watch Negative  11/08/2001 PR Newswire (Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire) NEW YORK, Nov. 8 /PRNewswire/ -- Standard & Poor's today lowered its rating on Yosemite Securities Trust I to triple-'B' from triple-'B'-plus and placed it on CreditWatch with negative implications (see list).\nThe lowered rating and CreditWatch placement reflects the Nov. 1, 2001 rating action taken on Enron Corp., which was based on Standard & Poor's belief that Enron Corp.'s plan to employ asset sales and other means to repair its damaged balance sheet will be insufficient to restore its long-term credit quality to the historical triple-'B'-plus level.\nAlso, the CreditWatch placement reflects the uncertainties surrounding the company and its credit quality in the short run due to the possibility of further unanticipated developments in the capital markets.\nYosemite Securities Trust I is a synthetic issue that utilizes a credit default swap referencing Enron Corp.\nThe rating on the credit-linked notes reflects the current senior unsecured rating of Enron Corp.\nYosemite Securities Trust I  $750 Million credit linked notes  Rating  To From  BBB/Watch Neg BBB+  /CONTACT: Mary Ryan, +1-212-438-2090, or Frank J Trick, +1-212-438-1108, both of Standard & Poor's/ 13:26 EST    Copyright ?\n2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nRPT Dynergy sharply higher, Enron lower on merger talks  11/08/2001 AFX News (c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd (Repeating to show in headline, lead that Enron is trading lower)  NEW YORK (AFX) -

A coal broker said counterparties were watching Enron's credit and limiting longer-term business with the company.  \"Everyone is nervous,\" a buyer at a Midwestern utility said.  Major coal producers and coal-burning utilities interviewed by Dow Jones Newswires on Wednesday said they hadn't suspended trading with Enron.  Physical prices were largely unaffected by the turmoil in the trading business and continued the downward trend that began in mid-October.  In the East, where prices softened in light trade, Central Appalachian barge deals for November delivery to the Big Sandy River were done in late October as low as $30.75 free on board, down from $33.50 a ton. December and the first quarter of 2002 traded several times Tuesday at $32.00 and $32.25 a ton, down $1.50 since late October.  Rail deliveries were pegged between $36.00 and $38.00 a ton FOB. No deals were confirmed.  In the West, Powder River Basin coal with a heat rate of 8,800 British thermal units slipped to $7.55 a ton for November, down a nickel since late October. Deals for calendar year 2002 were done at $8.10 and $8.15 a ton, down about 10 cents.  PRB 8,400 Btu coal traded very little, sources said. November deliveries deals were done at $5.90 a ton, down from $6.25 a ton at the end of October. Calendar year 2002 was pegged between $6.35 and $6.45 a ton, down 10 cents.  According to the Energy Information Agency, total U.S. coal production through Oct. 27, the latest date for which figures were available, ticked upward by 445,000 short tons to 21.8 million tons.  Appalachian coal production, year to date, was 2% ahead of last year. Total Appalachian production in 2001 is 356,557 tons, up from 349,711 tons in the same period last year.  U.S. Western coal production year to date remains steady at 6.4% ahead of 2000 figures. EIA reports total western coal production through Oct. 27 at 447,308 tons, up from 420,353 tons in the year-earlier period.  Railcar loadings through the end of October were 5% higher than comparable 2000 figures, according the EIA.  Activity on the New York Mercantile Exchange, which came to virtual standstill last week, picked up on Tuesday. On Tuesday, open interest for the December coal contract was at 217.

At 12.25 pm, Dynergy was up 3.17 usd, or 9.6 pct, at 36.17, Enron fell 0.34 usd, or 3.7 pct, to 8.71 usd and ChevronTexaco dropped 0.18 usd to 87.10.

Enron share price today was hurt after the company announced a restatement of its net income from 1997 to the third quarter of 2001. The revisions were, for the most part, reductions in the bottom-line figure.  The 8 bln usd tie-up talks, which come at a time when Enron is being investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the markets are losing faith in the energy trader, are seen as particularly positive for Dynergy.  Analysts see a tie-up as highly accretive for Dynergy, which is 26 pct owned by ChevronTexaco, with many synergies also possible.

LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - U.S. energy trading giant Enron Corp. , whose shares have tumbled amid a regulatory probe and doubts about its ability to raise cash, may lose or offload its metals business, senior industry sources said on Thursday.  In the wings are several interested parties looking to snap up the company's metals customer base. \"There are people out there with the experience and the contacts who see this time as a good opportunity to get into the market,\" a senior metals market source told Reuters on Thursday.  Such a move for Enron's metals portfolio would involve the acquisition of an existing organisation as a vehicle, the source added.  \"We do not comment on rumours,\" an Enron spokeswoman said, declining further comment.  Other Enron Metals assets were also said to be in play, including the Henry Bath warehousing company, which operates LME-registered warehouses in the UK, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United States.  MAJOR PLAYER  Houston-based Enron became a major player in the metals trade in May last year when it acquired MG plc, a leading independent international metals dealing firm in London, in a deal worth around 300 million pounds.  The company is a ring-dealing member of the London Metal Exchange (LME), able to participate in open-outcry floor trade, and is active in screen-based metals trade via its EnronOnline platform (www.enrononline.com).  The company no longer has a stake in online metals trading platform EMETRA (www.emetra.com), having sold its holding to other EMETRA shareholders this summer.  But while Enron may be a heavy hitter in the metals sector, base metals trading could hardly be regarded as one of its core businesses.  The company's third-quarter 2001 results statement shows income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) from \"Europe and other commodity markets\" - which includes metals and steel alongside European gas and power, among others - of $53 million, unchanged from the year-earlier period.  This compares with IBIT from Enron's gas and power market-making operations and merchant energy activities in North and South America of $710 million over the same period.  But the third-quarter figure that has slashed the value of the company's shares is a $1.2 billion write-down of shareholder equity related to off-balance sheet transactions.  On Thursday the company said it would restate its earnings for 1997 to 2001 to reflect the transactions - a move which wipes $613 million of the company's reported net income from 1997 through the first half of this year.  The company's stock has dropped by almost 78 percent since Enron released its earnings results on October 16, falling to nine-year lows amid concerns about the company's ability to raise cash.  The story added an extra twist on Wednesday as news broke that U.S.-based energy trading and marketing firm Dynegy Inc. was in talks to buy out Enron.  Against this background speculation is rife about the future of the metals operation, fuelled by the company's decision last month to trim between 10 and 20 percent of its metals workforce as part of a wider staff reduction by Enron Europe.  UNLIKELY TO REMAIN INTACT  Any decision by Enron or a possible future purchaser to offload its metals operations would be unlikely to see Enron Metals remain intact, traders said.  \"They paid $450 million for MG.\nWould they get $450 million for Enron Metals?\nI don't think so,\" said one.  \"Why buy the whole concern when you can cherry-pick the best traders and the clients will follow?\" added another.  An increasing emphasis on screen trading at the expense of personal contacts may already have persuaded some Enron clients to jump ship.  \"We've picked up a fair amount of small and mid-sized trade-type business in Europe from people who've said 'I'm not going to be told just to trade on a screen,'\" said one trader.  Another trader said: \"A lot of this business revolves around who you've been trading with and talking to over a period of time.\nIt's about individuals,\" he said.  \"Enron Online...should be seen as an 'added value' product, not as the only way of trading.\nCustomers still want to talk to their broker, and are willing to pay commission for the service,\" the senior source said.  Enron's financial position could also prompt customers to consider other options, the first trader said.  \"As a customer, you want to place your business where there's financial stability.\nIf a company isn't financially stable, you'll move elsewhere.\n\"  Enron's trade counterparties are also keeping a close eye on the company's financial situation, said a trader at one LME brokerage.  \"People aren't particularly concerned about short-term trading (with Enron), but when it comes to OTC business done outside the clearing market they're backing off a bit,\" he said.

(ENE) said it will restate its financial results from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001, as the embattled energy company and Dynegy Inc. both confirmed they are in talks on a possible business combination.  In a filing Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Enron said its financial and audit reports are unreliable for those periods. Enron said that three \"unconsolidated entities should have been included in its consolidated financial statements,\" based on generally accepted accounting principles. These entities are Chewco Investments LP, Joint Energy Development Investments LP and a wholly owned unit of LJM Cayman LP.  Enron said it has established a special committee to review all transactions. The committee will specifically review all \"economic results\" related to transactions between Enron and LJM.  Last month Enron took a $1.01 billion charge in the third quarter related to write-downs of investments. Of this, $35 million was attributed to partnerships run until recently by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who has since been replaced. Enron also disclosed it shrank shareholder equity by $1.2 billion, as a result of several transactions including ones undertaken with Fastow's investment vehicle.  Later, Enron said the SEC would investigate the company's \"related party transactions,\" including those with the Fastow partnerships.  The restatement will reflect the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholders' equity, as well as various income-statement and balance-sheet adjustments determined by Enron and its auditors.  \"We believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about these matters,\" said Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay  Over the past couple of days, Enron has been scrambling to line up quick financing from a prominent outside investor and has been in discussions with private-equity firms and power-trading companies.  Earlier, The Wall Street Journal reported that Dynegy was trying to buy Enron for $7 billion to $8 billion in stock. Both are Houston-based energy-trading and power companies.  Because any combination of the two would likely be scrutinized for many months, and Enron needs to shore up its finances now, Dynegy reportedly is expected to inject $1.5 billion into Enron immediately, people familiar with the matter said.  ChevronTexaco Corp. (CVX), which owns a 26% stake in Dynegy, is expected to provide Dynegy with the funds for the cash infusion and is playing a significant role in the negotiations, the Journal said.  The boards of Dynegy, Chevron and Enron reportedly met Wednesday to discuss a potential deal. Enron's stock has plunged since Oct. 16, when the company posted a $618 million third-quarter loss and revealed that its shareholder equity had been reduced.  The talks between Enron and Dynegy follow a sharp decline in Enron's stock over the past several weeks.    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. , the embattled energy trader, said on Thursday fired its treasurer and a counsel who the company said were part-owners of one of its off-balance sheet partnerships now under investigation by U.S. regulators.  Enron said it was terminating the employment of Ben Glisan, managing director and treasurer of Enron Corp., and Kristina Mordaunt, a managing director and counsel of an Enron division. Enron said it believes that these two employees, along with four other former Enron employees, were involved as partners in a limited partnership called the LJM1 that had dealings with Enron.

The restatement have no effect on Enron's current financial position, it said. In its restated figures, Enron posted reductions to net income of 96 mln usd in 1997, 113 mln usd in 1998, 250 mln in 1999 and 132 mln in 2000, as well as increases of 17 mln usd for the first quarter of 2001 and 5 mln for the second, but reduced the third quarter figure by 17 mln usd.  The restatement will have no negative impact on the company's reported earnings for the nine month period ending Sept 2001, however, it said.  The company said its changes to net income are the result of the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments LP and Chewco Investments LP beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of the LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  The JEDI and Chewco consolidations will increase Enron's debt by about 711 mln usd in 1997, 561 mln in 1998, 685 mln in 1999 and 628 mln in 2000, the company said.  kgd/jkm/ For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved. NEW YORK (AP) - Beleaguered energy trading giant Enron Corp. announced Thursday it would restate its earnings since 1997, in part to reflect a controversial dlrs 1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that has sparked a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.  Enron, whose stock price has fallen roughly 80 percent in the past three weeks, also said it was holding talks with Dynegy Inc. relating to some form of business transaction. The New York Times reported that Dynegy was considering buying Enron, its larger hometown rival for dlrs 8 billion. In a filing with the SEC, Enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 \"should not be relied upon\" and that partnerships run by Enron officials during that period should have been consolidated into the financial results of the Houston-based energy trading giant.  These partnerships are Chewco Investments L.P., Joint Energy Development Investments L.P., and a wholly owned unit of LJM Cayman L.P.  \"We believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about these matters,\" said Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive.  By its own assessment, Enron's restatement reduces previously reported net income by roughly dlrs 586 million and increases its debt by dlrs 2.59 billion. The change reflects the financial impact of retroactively consolidating the partnerships.  The company also fired two executives on Thursday: Ben Glisan, its treasurer, and Kristina Mordaunt, general counsel for one of its divisions. Previously, Enron had ousted chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who was in charge of some of the partnerships.  Shares of Enron were off 10 cents to dlrs 8.95 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Enron said it believes the restatement will include a reduction to net income of about dlrs 96 million in 1997, dlrs 113 million in 1998, dlrs 250 million in 1999 and dlrs 132 million in 2000, increases of dlrs 17 million for the first quarter of 2001 and dlrs 5 million for the second quarter and a reduction of dlrs 17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  Enron, the top buyer and seller of natural gas and the top wholesale marketer in the United States, had become one of the nation's 10 largest companies, recording revenue of dlrs 100.8 billion in 2000.  But the company has been beset by huge investment losses and questions about its financial stability. In particular, its stock has plunged since Oct. 16, when the company posted a dlrs 618 million third quarter loss and revealed that its shareholder equity had been reduced.  Enron's woes have prompted considerable speculation about a possible takeover of the company.  Besides Dynegy, companies mentioned as possible suitors included General Electric's GE Capital unit and Royal Dutch/Shell Group.  On Thursday, both Dynegy and Enron released statements confirming they were in talks, but declined to provide any details.  The New York Times reported earlier that Dynegy is considering paying about dlrs 8 billion in stock, or roughly dlrs 10 per share.  Under the terms of the deal, Enron would receive an immediate dlrs 1.5 billion cash infusion from oil giant Chevron Texaco, which holds a 27 percent stake in Dynegy, the Times said, citing executives close to the discusssion.  Chevron Texaco would provide an additional dlrs 1 billion injection at a later date, the Times reported, while Dynegy would assume dlrs 12.8 billion in Enron debt, plus billions of dollars in other debt that has been kept off the beleaguered company's balance sheet and has been a significant contributor to its current problems.

HOUSTON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. said on Thursday it provided U.S. regulators with more information about off-balance sheet deals, and other transactions that led to a shattering of the company's credibility and to an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Enron, the once high-flying Houston-based energy trading company, also confirmed it was in talks with its hometown rival Dynegy Inc. over a possible business combination. Terms of any deal have not been agreed on, the two companies said. Enron said that it will restate its earnings from 1997 to 2000 and the first two quarters of 2001 as the company addresses concerns raised by the SEC and shareholders.  Shares of Enron dropped 20 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $8.85 in Thursday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Enron, the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in North America, said the required restatement reflects the surprising - and controversial - $1.2 billion reduction to shareholders' equity the company recently disclosed.  The restatement also reflects adjustments to the company's income statement and balance sheet, now that Enron has decided that the financial activities of Chewco Investments, L.P., Joint Energy Development Investments Limited Partnership (JEDI) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of LJM1 should indeed have been included in the company's consolidated financial statements.  As a result of the restatement, Enron is reducing its 1997 net income by about $96 million, 1998 net income by $113 million, 1999 net income by $250 million and 2000 net income by $132 million.  It is also restating first quarter 2001 results with a $17 million net income increase, second quarter 2001 results with a $5 million increase and third quarter 2001 results with a $17 million net income decrease.  Consolidating Chewco and JEDI also increases Enron's debt by about $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.  \"We believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about these matters,\" said Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay in a statement.

Bailout Seen Unlikely By Jason Leopold  11/08/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  (This story initially ran late Wednesday.) LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Maybe Enron Corp. (ENE) is just too big to fail. Maybe not.  Is the embattled energy trading company important enough to qualify for a federal bailout?  Not likely, according to a number of analysts who believe that there are enough big energy companies in the U.S. to keep markets liquid if Enron goes under.  For that reason, a federal bailout is probably not in the cards, even though Enron controls about 25% of U.S. natural gas and electricity markets, they added.  \"A bailout would only occur if needed to maintain liquidity in the energy markets in order to avoid potential for skyrocketing prices and avoid reliability risks,\" said Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER) analyst Steven Fleishman. \"In the end, government is most interested in keeping the lights and the heat on at a reasonable price.\n\"  Once a Wall Street darling, Enron's stock has fallen about by 75% in a mere three weeks, and the company is now the subject of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.  Because it's so big, energy companies have watched Enron's troubles closely, and speculated about what they could mean for energy markets overall. A number have said they've started to cut back on their exposure to the company.  Enron's stock has been falling all year, but it plunged several weeks ago after it disclosed a $1.2 billion writedown of shareholder equity. The SEC subsequently launched an investigation into Enron partnerships associated with the writedown.  Enron spokesperson Karen Denne said the company wouldn't speculate on the idea of a bailout.  \"First of all I can't speculate, and second of all we're not even going to entertain worst case scenarios,\" Denne said. \"As far as I know no one has approached Washington about a federal bailout.\n\"  But one source inside Enron said the company isn't ruling out the possibility of approaching Washington if \"things get really bad.\n\"  A bailout would require federal legislation.  To qualify, Enron would have to argue that a bailout is an economic necessity, according to Christine Uspenski, an analyst at Schwab Capital Markets (SCH). Quite Different Cup Of Tea From Chrysler   Unlike the situation that led to a $1.2 billion federal bailout of Chrysler Corp. in 1980, hundreds of thousands of jobs aren't now at risk. Enron is nowhere near the size of Chrysler.  \"When Chrysler was bailed out there were senators and congressman who were going to have unemployed constituents so they proposed federal legislation to give the company a $1.2 billion loan,\" Uspenski said. \"A bailout would need federal legislation proposed by Texas delegation.\nIt would be hard because Enron is not the size of an employer like Chrysler.\nThe one caveat is bailouts happen to be the fashion of the moment.\nEnron would have to make a compelling case that this is an economic necessity.\nThey would have to quantify the risk to the energy market and there's such bad karma around the energy market right now.\n\"  Robert Christensen, an analyst with FAC Equities in New York, agreed.  \"I can't even imagine something like that happening,\" Christensen said. \"It's so far-fetched.\n\"  A merger, on the other hand, would funnel billions of dollars into Enron, keep the company afloat and might help the company's stock recover, analysts said.  On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Enron is in talks for a capital infusion and possible acquisition by Dynegy Inc. (DYN). Also, Enron said Thursday it will restate its financial statements from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001, saying its financial and audit reports are unreliable for all those periods. The company fired its treasurer and general counsel.  Andrew Meade, an analyst with Commerzbank in New York, said a bailout would likely never materialize because there are other large traders of energy commodities in the marketplace, such as Duke Energy (DUK), Dynegy, Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Williams Cos. (WMB), that can provide liquidity to the market.  A merger would be a better route for the company, but would pose its own set of problems, Meade added.  \"With a merger or an equity infusion, Enron can certainly survive,\" Meade said. \"Enron has a lot of nice attributes, it is a great trading and marketing platform and companies are certainly smart to take a look at it.\nBut merging with or buying Enron is not an easy thing to do because of troublesome issues like a federal investigation and a range of assets that would be pretty tough to sell.\n\"  Enron's best assets \"get up and go home everyday,\" Meade said, referring to energy traders at the company. If Enron were to get into a friendly merger or buyout, he added, the company should lock in its top 50 or 100 traders with non-compete clauses. It would be much easier for Dynegy or other Houston energy companies to simply hire Enron employees rather than buy the company.  Other analysts also pointed to risks in a merger with Enron.  \"A merger is certainly an option, but it gives you pause if it asks you to be the white knight,\" Uspenski said. A proposed merger could turn out to be a \"minefield and there would certainly be a pretty sizable exposure.\nIt would definitely make shareholders nervous.\n\"  Gerald Keenan, a partner in PWC Consulting in Chicago, was skeptical about the proposed reports of a merger between Dynegy and Enron.  \"Dynegy is not that big a company,\" Keenan said. \"It has a market cap of about $14 billion.\nWhat Enron needs is someone to carry it.\nHow is an entity like Dynegy going to carry Enron?\nEnron has a small market cap but a huge balance sheet.\n\"  Keenan also said Enron wouldn't be likely to secure a federal bailout.  \"The only caveat would be if the bailout would have some kind of significant effect on energy commodity markets,\" Keenan said. \"Other than that, it's unlikely the federal government will bail Enron out.\n\"  -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

New York, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds pared earlier gains as the biggest energy trader said it restated earnings for more than four years, increasing concern that Dynegy Inc. won't buy out the company.       Enron's 7.88 percent coupon notes due in 2003 traded at 77 cents on the dollar to yield 27 percent, down from a bid of 82 cents this morning, traders said. The debt, which was trading near 100 last month, was bid at 77 cents yesterday. Enron shares, down 75 percent in the last month, fell 64 cents to $8.41 today.       Dynegy said today it's in talks to acquire Enron in what people familiar with the situation said would likely be a stock transaction worth $8 billion. An acquisition would bolster Enron's credit rating, which was recently lowered, traders said.       \"Enron bonds justifiably rallied on the good news of Dynegy. They naturally settled back down as the market assesses the significance of the restatement,\" said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst at CreditSights Inc. \"The whole problem goes away and sighs of relief all around if they come to terms with Dynegy.\"       Enron's 6.4 percent notes due in 2006 were bid at around 70 cents, down from this morning when the debt traded at 84 cents. Yesterday, the notes were priced between 72 cents and 74 cents.       The difference between bid and ask prices for Enron debt widened to about 4 cents to 5 cents -- \"monster\" spreads, Reynolds said -- from 2 cents this morning, indicating few investors are willing to buy or sell the bonds without more news.       While Moody's Investors Service rates Enron's credit as \"Baa2\", one rung higher than its \"Baa3\" grade for Dynegy, other ratings companies including Standard & Poor's and Fitch Inc. have assigned Dynegy a higher rating. Also, Enron's ratings have been cut in recent weeks and face further reduction, while Dynegy's credit outlook is stable.       Enron bonds and shares have tumbled in recent weeks on concern about partnerships run by the company's former chief financial officer and concerns the company's trading business will be hurt by the credit downgrades. Enron and Dynegy are both based in Houston.       Enron has $15.8 billion of bonds outstanding, more than double the $6.8 billion market value of its stock, according to Bloomberg data.    Apache to Cut 2002 Drilling Budget 70% on Gas Prices (Update1) 2001-11-08 16:34 (New York)  Apache to Cut 2002 Drilling Budget 70% on Gas Prices (Update1)       (Updates with closing share price in fifth paragraph and closing Nymex gas price in last paragraph.)       Houston, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Apache Corp., an oil and natural-gas producer, plans to cut spending on drilling next year by 70 percent, blaming wide swings in gas prices caused by traders such as Enron Corp. and Dynegy Inc.       The company will trim spending to $300 million from $1 billion this year, Chief Executive Officer Raymond Plank said in an interview. Gas on the New York Mercantile Exchange reached $10.10 per million British thermal units in late December and touched $1.76 per million British thermal units in September.       The market for gas derivatives is 15 times the cash market for delivery to customers, and broad price changes make it difficult for oil and gas companies to set budgets, Plank said.       \"You've got a 150-pound tail wagging a 10-pound dog,\" Plank said. \"You can't predict what your cash flow may be.\nTherefore, your budgeting is difficult.\n\"       Shares of Apache were unchanged at $50.73. They have fallen 28 percent this year. Apache, Dynegy and Enron, the biggest energy trader, are based in Houston.       \"We can always go back and take another look at (spending) later,\" Apache spokesman Tony Lentini said. \"We look at our (budget) regularly, and we're known for moving pretty quickly.\n\"       Enron, whose plunging stock price forced it to begin merger talks with rival Dynegy, today restated earnings for more than four years because of losses from partnerships under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.       Fearing an Enron collapse might cripple the gas-derivatives market, Apache said yesterday it traded out of most of its gas hedges, making $70 million so far.       \"Apache is trying to conserve cash and retain the maximum amount of flexibility,\" said Irene Haas, an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris Inc. \"Apache has been traditionally very nimble in responding to these cycles.\nThere's something to be said for being cautious and conservative when the visibility is bad.\n\"       Haas rates Apache \"accumulate\" and doesn't own its shares.       Nymex gas has averaged $2.7 per million British thermal units so far this quarter, down almost half from the same time a year earlier. It rose 9 cents to $2.96 per million British thermal units today.    Enron Fires Treasurer, Alleges Improper Investment (Update2) 2001-11-08 16:31 (New York)  Enron Fires Treasurer, Alleges Improper Investment (Update2)       (Updates with closing share prices in ninth paragraph and information on board approval starting in 17th paragraph.)       Houston, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which today reduced its earnings for the last four years by $552 million because of accounting errors involving affiliates, also said it fired its treasurer and a corporate attorney for making improper investments in one of the affiliates.       Enron fired Treasurer Ben Glisan and Kristina Mordaunt, the general counsel of an unspecified Enron division. The two invested in an affiliate created by Enron to buy and sell the company's assets, the Houston-based company said in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.       The transactions also involved two former Enron employees and former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who was replaced two weeks ago, the filing said. The former employees were Kathy Lynn, vice president of an unnamed Enron division, and Anne Yaeger, identified by Enron as a non-officer employee.       Lea Fastow, Andrew Fastow's wife, referred all questions to her husband's attorney, who couldn't immediately be reached for comment. Glisan wouldn't comment. Attempts to reach Mordaunt weren't successful.                          $30 Million Profit       Fastow made more than $30 million by managing and investing in two private limited partnerships called LJM Cayman LP, known as LJM1, and LJM2 Co-Investment LP. Enron said on Oct. 24 that Fastow had been replaced as CFO and put on leave. The filing said he is no longer with the company.       Enron said it believes Lynn and Yaeger remain associated with LJM2.       The SEC began a formal investigation into some of Enron's partnerships last month, causing the stock price to plummet from already low levels. Shares of Enron had fallen 89 percent this year, as of the close of trading yesterday.       Enron, short on cash, began merger talks with Dynegy Inc. Yesterday, it failed to reach an agreement with Dynegy to sell itself for about $8 billion in stock. ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 27 percent of Dynegy, is also involved in the talks. Dynegy is concerned credit rating companies may downgrade Enron's debt, people familiar with the situation said.       Enron shares fell 64 cents, or 7.1 percent, $8.41. Shares of Dynegy, which is also based in Houston, rose $3.50, or 11 percent, to $36.50. ChevronTexaco rose 31 cents to $87.59.                              Restatement       Enron restated its earnings for the past four years and the first three quarters of 2001 to incorporate the first LJM partnership, as well as Chewco Investments LP and Joint Energy Development Investments LP, known as JEDI.       Enron calls them special purpose entities, or SPEs. They are vehicles for getting access to capital or hedging risk that can be moved off the books under some circumstances. Enron established more than 30 SPEs.       The company reported that Enron and \"Enron-related entities\" participated in 24 \"business relationships\" in which LJM1 or LJM2 participated. They included the sale of asset such as unused fiber optic cable, the purchase of debt or equity interests in Enron affiliates, and the sale by LJM2 of a call and a put option on some assets.      In addition to Chewco and JEDI, a wholly owned subsidiary of LMJ1 that \"engaged in derivative transactions with Enron to permit Enron to hedge market risks of an equity investment in Rhythms NetConnections, Inc.,\" which provides high-speed networking to businesses.       Enron said in the SEC filing that those hedging transactions should have been consolidated into its 1999 and 2000 results because the LJM1 subsidiary was inadequately capitalized. Enron did not specify why transactions by Chewco and JEDI should have been included on its balance sheet.       Enron said it believes that Michael J. Kopper, a former company employee, managed a Chewco general partner and invested in it. The company said it also believes that Kopper was the controlling partner of a limited partnership that (through another limited partnership) in March 2000 purchased interests in affiliated subsidiaries of LJM1.\"       The company said that it believes the limited partners in that deal also included Glisan, Mordaunt, Lynn and Yaeger.\nAn \"entity associated with\" Fastow was also a limited partner, Enron said.\nEnron said that its board approved Fastow's initial transaction with LJM1 and put controls in place that required the review and approval of each transaction by the office of the chairman, the chief accounting officer and the chief risk officer.\nLay and Skilling were for many years the only members of the office of the chairman.\nAfter Skilling's resignation in August, Enron promoted Greg Whalley to president and chief operating officer and Mark Frevert to vice chairman.\nBoth became members of the office of the chairman.\nLay, as chairman, also had the authority to require Fastow to resign from the partnerships at any time.\nThe board also directed that its Audit and Compliance Committee conduct annual reviews of transactions between Enron and LJM1 and LJM2 completed during the previous year, the filing said.\nDynegy Rises on Optimism It May Get Enron for Bargain (Update2) 2001-11-08 16:28 (New York)  Dynegy Rises on Optimism It May Get Enron for Bargain (Update2)       (Updates with closing share prices.)

Purchase, New York, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- NewPower Holdings Inc., a venture formed by Enron Corp. to compete with traditional gas and electric utilities, said its third-quarter loss narrowed after cutting costs and adding customers.\nThe loss was $67.1 million, or $1.15 a share, compared with a loss of $69.9 million, or $2.96, a year earlier.\nRevenue tripled to $54.7 million from $18.2 million, the company said.\nNewPower was forecast to have a loss of $1.16 a share, the average estimate of three analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.\nNewPower added 80,000 customers in the third quarter and expects to have 840,000 to 860,000 customers by the end of the year.\nThe company, based in Purchase, New York, reduced sales, general and administrative costs by 41 percent, primarily by cutting systems-development and professional expenses.\nThe company is eliminating 40 jobs, or 22 percent of its workforce, to cut costs, Chief Financial Officer William Jacobs said on a conference call.\nNewPower expects costs of $16 million in the fourth quarter for severance and to end a business alliance with AOL Time Warner Inc., spokeswoman Gael Doar said.\nEnron, the largest energy trader, owns about 44 percent of NewPower.\nHouston-based Enron, whose shares have fallen 75 percent since Oct. 16 amid concern over affiliated partnerships run by its former chief financial officer, said it had $544 million in losses on investments including NewPower in the third quarter.\nShares of NewPower rose 42 cents to $1.23.\nThe company first sold shares to the public in October 2000 for $21 a share.\nThe offering increased the number of shares outstanding to about 58 million from 23 million.\nFourth Quarter       Excluding costs for severance and to end the AOL agreement, NewPower expects a fourth-quarter loss of $41 million to $46 million, or 65 cents to 73 cents a share, and a full-year loss of $210 million to $215 million, or $3.55 to $3.63.\nThe company was expected to lose 74 cents in the fourth quarter, according to First Call's average of three analysts' estimates.\nThe full-year's loss was expected to be $3.71, the average of four analysts' estimates.\nIn 2002, NewPower expects to have a loss of $100 million to $125 million, or $1.59 to $1.99 a share.\nThe average estimate of four analysts polled by First Call was $2.26.\nNewPower expects to be profitable in 2003 with 1.5 million customers.\nThe company is focusing more on small businesses.\nIt now has 25,000 small-business customers and expects to have more than 35,000 by the end of the year.\nInternational Business Machines Corp. owns 1.5 million shares of NewPower, less than 5 percent of the company.\nEnron Restates Years of Profits, in Talks With Dynegy (Update4) 2001-11-08 15:41 (New York)  Enron Restates Years of Profits, in Talks With Dynegy (Update4)       (Adds Dynegy share price in sixth paragraph.)       Houston, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which began merger talks with Dynegy Inc. after its stock plunged, restated earnings for more than four years to include losses from investment partnerships arranged by senior executives.\nThe largest energy trader failed yesterday to reach an agreement with Dynegy to sell itself for about $8 billion in stock.\nDynegy is concerned credit rating companies may downgrade Enron's debt, people familiar with the situation said.\nA reduction to junk status would precipitate a cash crisis by requiring Enron to repay early $3.3 billion of bonds.\n\"Restating earnings for the past five years is suggestive of fraud, which in itself is justification for a downgrade,\" said Donald Coxe, who manages 78,000 Enron shares as part of the Harris Insight Equity Fund.\n\"I'd be surprised if they're not downgraded.\"       The decision by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay to reduce earnings by $586 million since 1997 is part of Enron's efforts to regain confidence among investors stung by the 89 percent plunge in the stock this year and a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into how the company accounted for partnerships it sponsored.\nEnron fired Treasurer Ben Glisan and Kristina Mourdant, a lawyer for an Enron division.\nThe company \"now believes\" Glisan, Mourdant and two other employees no longer working for Enron bought interests in subsidiaries of a partnership run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.\nDynegy's shares rose as much as 14 percent on speculation that it may decide not to buy cash-strapped Enron, or, if it did, wouldn't pay much of a premium.\n\"People are betting for or against a deal with Enron,\" said Andre Meade, an analyst with Commerzbank AG who rates Enron \"accumulate.\"\nDynegy \"is unlikely to pay significantly more than Enron's current share price if it does make a bid,\" he said.\nShares Decline       Enron shares declined 40 cents to $8.65 after the company determined it violated generally accepted accounting rules when it failed to consolidate results for three so-called special purpose entities, vehicles for getting access to capital or hedging risk that can be moved off the books under some circumstances.\nEnron ousted Fastow last month after revealing an accounting error for transactions with a group of the partnerships resulted in a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in the third quarter.\nArthur Andersen LLP was Enron's independent auditor.\nThe company today reduced 1997 net income by $96 million, 1998 earnings by $113 million, 1999 results by $250 million, and 2000 earnings by $132 million.\nIn 2001, the changes resulted in an increase to net income of $17 million in the first quarter and $5 million in the second quarter, and a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter.\nEnron bonds pared gains after the earnings were restated, as the threat of a credit downgrade dimmed a rally sparked by the Dynegy talks.\nEnron's debt doubled in the past four years to $13 billion at the end of the third quarter.\nBoth Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service are considering lowering their ratings, which are two levels above junk.\n\"Enron is running out of time and that's what's pushing them to the bargaining table,\" said Zach Wagner, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co., who cut his recommendation on Enron to \"reduce\" from \"accumulate\" on Oct. 23.\nSecurities regulators are investigating Enron's web of more than 30 partnerships, including two in which Fastow served as general partner: LJM Cayman LP, known as LJM1, and LJM2 Co- Investment LP, known as LJM2.\nFastow received more than $30 million from LJM investments and management fees, Enron said.\nLabyrinth       The company reported that Enron and \"Enron-related entities\" participated in 24 \"business relationships\" in which LJM1 or LJM2 participated.\nThey included the sale of assets, such as unused fiber optic cable, the purchase of debt or equity interests in Enron affiliates, and the sale by LJM2 of a call and a put option on assets.\nThe partnerships involved in the restatement are Chewco Investments LP; Joint Energy Development Investments, known as JEDI; and a wholly owned subsidiary of LJM1 that \"engaged in derivative transactions with Enron to permit Enron to hedge market risks of an equity investment in Rhythms NetConnections Inc.,\" which provides high-speed networking to businesses.\nSome companies that trade natural gas, electricity and other commodities with Enron may pull back if Enron's finances deteriorate to the point that it loses its investment-grade credit rating, investors say.\nAtlanta-based Mirant Corp., a top U.S. energy trader, has moved most of its trades away from Enron to other exchanges, such as Intercontinenal Exchange, a venture it formed in March 2000 with other partners including BP Plc and Goldman, Sachs & Co., Mirant spokesman James Peters said.\n\"We are still trading with them, but on a very limited basis,\" said Peters.\n\"Dynegy has to act fast,\" said Roger Hamilton, a money manager with John Hancock Advisers Inc., which sold its Enron shares in recent weeks.\n\"If Enron can't get financing and its bonds go to junk, they lose counterparties and their marvelous business vanishes.\"       Dynegy would gain a wholesale energy business, the leading energy manager for commercial and small-industrial customers, and an Internet energy trading operation many times larger than its own, said UBS Warburg LLC analyst James Yanello.\n\"If history is any guide, Dynegy is stingy when it comes to acquisitions, so I don't expect them to do anything stupid\" such as overpaying for Enron, said Yanello.\n\"A deal could provide Dynegy with tremendous opportunity.\"\nHe rates Dynegy \"strong buy\" and doesn't own shares of either company.\nChevronTexaco Corp., which owns about 27 percent of Dynegy, is considering adding $1.5 billion to the transaction to help Enron.\nIt would provide another $1 billion when the purchase is closed, the New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported.\nBreakup Fee       The companies agreed on a breakup fee providing Dynegy with about $400 million if Enron accepts a higher offer, people familiar with the talks said.\nDynegy's shares rose as much as $4.30, or 13 percent, to $37.30.\nThe stock had dropped $3 yesterday when news of the Enron talks was first reported.\nDynegy spokesman Steve Stengel, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer and ChevronTexaco spokesman Fred Gorell declined to comment.\nEnron plans to meet with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and other lenders tomorrow to discuss the merger plans and a possible increase in the amount the company pays for existing credit lines, according to bankers familiar with the matter.\nThe company has invited more than 300 creditors to its offices in Houston to listen to presentations by Enron's financial team, led by its new chief financial officer, Jeffrey McMahon, the bankers said.\nDynegy began in 1985 as Natural Gas Clearinghouse, a gas- trading company.\nIn 1998, the company took the name Dynegy -- a combination of the words dynamic and energy -- to reflect its expansion beyond natural gas.\nChuck Watson, the company's president from 1985, became chairman and chief executive in 1989.\nWatson is an investor with Enron CEO Lay in the Houston Texans, who begin playing in the National Football League next year, and is a board member at Baker Hughes Inc.\nAs of an April filing with the SEC, Watson owned 12.3 million Dynegy shares, or about 5.1 percent of the common stock.\nDJ FABER REPORT: More On Enron/Dynegy >ENE 2001-11-08 16:00 (New York)      (The following is a portion of a report aired at 3 p.m. Thursday by CNBC reporter David Faber).\nEnron and Dynegy are still talking about a deal that would result in Enron's purchase by Dynegy.\nAnd they would like to either announce a transaction or the lack of one, in the near term.\nIt's still unclear at what price Enron would be purchased, or if the deal will end up as a large investment.\nPeople close to the talks do not expect a large premium.\nA key challenge at present for Dynegy is whether it can conduct enough due diligence of an incredibly complex financial structure to feel comfortable with a takeover.\nThat point was made clear today given Enron just released restated financial results for the last four years of operations.\nIts peak earnings in 2000 had been $1.12 a share.\nNow those earnings have been restated to 97 cents.\nThe key to Enron's restatement is the treatment of three off balance sheet partnerships whose debt is guaranteed by Enron.\nGiven that guarantee, Enron's auditors have now concluded the partnerships should have been included on Enron's books.\nThe debt from the partnership has been included in recent quarters, but not for years previous.\nAnd if it had been, Enron might not have been able to employ as much leverage in running its business and supercharge the returns on some of its trades.\nWhile Dynegy understands Enron's trading business as well as any company could, it still would seem to need time to review its trading book.\nWith the restatement, Enron's return on capital and return on equity is in the mid-single digits.\nThat's well below the ROEs of banks and brokers which Enron most closely resembles in its trading activities.\nOther issues are also sure to be explored.\nFor example, why did Enron have to extend deposits to counter parties during the June 2001 quarter if business was so good, as would appear to have been the case given the company's strong earnings?\nAnd what about Enron's use of derivatives for these relatively new type trades?\nAll these are questions that Dynegy may not have time to answer and so instead may be seeking an expansive material adverse change clause in any merger agreement which will give it wide latitude to exit a deal should it discover things it doesn't like in the future.\nDynegy, Enron negotiating merger Enron fires two officers; financial results to be restated  CBSMarketWatch.com Lisa Sanders NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- Enron's troubles deepened Thursday as the energy merchant confirmed it's in merger talks with Dynegy and announced, in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, that it fired two officers and is restating financial results for four years and two quarters.\nBoth Dynegy and Enron confirmed Thursday that they're in negotiations following a published report that an $8 billion deal was close to being finalized.\nThe New York Times reported that Dynegy's board approved a stock offer worth $10 a share for Enron.\nWhile confirming the talks, the companies released no further details.\nDynegy had no additional comment.\nAn Enron spokeswoman stonewalled reporters Thursday by saying the company was requiring all questions to be submitted in writing.\nEnron did not respond to the questions.\nShares of Enron (ENE ) initially rallied but closed at $8.41, down 64 cents, or 7.1 percent, while Dynegy (DYN ) tacked on $3.50 to close at $36.50.\nChevronTexaco (CVX ), which owns 27 percent of Dynegy, will contribute $2.5 billion to the deal, the Times reported.\nChevronTexaco, which added 31 cents to close at $87.59, declined to comment.\nAlso Thursday, Enron in an SEC filing said it has fired its treasurer, Ben Glisan, and the general counsel of an Enron division, Kristina Mordaunt.\nEarlier in the month, Enron fired chief financial officer Andy Fastow for his role in limited partnerships that are now under investigation by the SEC.\nEnron restated its financial results for the years 1997 through 2000 and the first two quarters of 2001.\nEnron has lost most of its market value over the past month after the SEC launched a probe of some transactions by company executives.\nEnron would bring huge debt A merger of Dynegy and Enron would require the smaller company to take on the $12.8 billion in debt that's now on Enron's books.\nThe acquisition would likely lead to the sale of additional Enron assets to pay down the debts, the Times reported.\nBoards of both companies were meeting in Houston on Wednesday night, according to the paper.\n\"If you look at the balance sheets of Dynegy and Enron, (a merger) would be a tough deal,\" Jeff Dietert of Simmons & Co.\nHe noted that Dynegy (DYN ) has $3 billion worth of debt and a market capitalization of $11.7 billion.\n\"Enron's debt load is likely to be too significant for Dynegy to step up and swallow,\" Dietert said.\nFor Dynegy to make the deal, it would have to issue equity, he added.\nIt would make more sense for Dynegy to consider buying some Enron assets, Dietert said.\nThat would also help Enron clean up its balance sheet.\nChris Ellinghaus of Williams Capital Group said that ChevronTexaco's involvement would make a Dynegy-Enron combination more realistic.\n\"We would view this transaction favorably assuming Dynegy intends to dispose of Enron's myriad of non-core businesses,\" Ellinghaus said.\nDynegy and Enron together would dwarf other natural gas and power marketers in the U.S.  Ellinghaus said the possibility that Dynegy would buy Enron is \"staggering.\" \"However, the failure of Enron to procure an outside equity infusion has apparently severely limited Enron's options,\" he said.\n\"We do not believe the potential demise of Enron invalidates the merchant energy model or suggest deeper problems within the wholesale energy markets.\"\nGregory Phelps, vice president and portfolio manager of John Hancock's Patriot Group of closed-end income funds, said Enron, even in its current state, retains some intrinsic value.\n\"Enron still has an incredible number of contractual trading arrangements out there that can't be allowed to crumble and fall,\" he added.\n\"I think that a firm like Dynegy with a firm like ChevronTexaco as partner adds the credibility that Enron needs.\"\nDynegy gets to buy \"assets on the cheap\" that it can tie into its own growth-oriented operations, he said.\nPhelps has never owned Enron stock in his funds because he says it's too volatile and the company makes it too hard to understand how it generates revenue.\nBush ties  Enron's Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay stepped back into the CEO spot following the abrupt departure of Jeffrey K. Skilling, who left after just six months on the job for \"personal reasons.\"\nSkilling was called to testify in Washington, D.C., this week, though the SEC would not confirm whether it was before their agency.\nIn a conference call with investors Wednesday, El Paso Energy Chairman and Chief Executive William Wise said his company would consider buying some of Enron's assets, though he declined to specify which ones.\n\"We are an asset-oriented company, and we would look at their assets,\" Wise said.\n\"Rather than list any of them for you, you can make your own judgments.\"  Wednesday, A.G. Edwards cut its rating on Enron to \"sell\" from \"hold,\" saying the only reason to own the stock now would be to bet that some company would bid for Enron or a large part of its wholesale trading operations.\nAzurix divestiture  Also Thursday, Azurix Corp., an affiliate of Enron, said it sold its Azurix North America and Azurix Industrial to American Water Works for $141.5 million in cash and the assumption of $6.1 million of debt.\nAzurix is a water and wastewater company.\nIn the third quarter, Enron took a $1 billion charge, which included $287 million for asset impairments at Azurix.\nLisa Sanders is a Dallas-based reporter for CBS.MarketWatch.com."}
{"text": "Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets   Wow!\nWhat a year 2001 has been for the supporters of energy competition.\nFor every good bit of news (Pat Wood, one of our heroes at CAEM, being selected to head the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the continuing progress that the Canadians ? yes, the Canadians ? have made towards energy competition), we have had to bear one disaster and misstep after another throughout the year.\nLet?\ns see, in December 2000, who could have predicted?\n.\n1.  The tragic events of September 11th.\n2.  The California implosion.\n3.  Pennsylvania marketer retrenchment.\n4.  Price volatility and high prices (but it could have been worse if Mother Nature did not help out).\n5.  Bush Energy Plan ignores meaningful restructuring.\n6.  Enron collapse.\n7.  FERC Blinks on Super RTO.\n8.  Texas missteps in pilots for opening the market.\n9.  No leadership emerged to meet the crisis in restructuring.\n2001 was one heck of a year ?\nbut thankfully, probably the nadir of the movement towards energy competition in North America.\nAs CAEM looks into our crystal ball (natural gas fired, of course) for the coming year, we see a better year.\nBelow are some of the predictions and responses from the CAEM staff about what we expect to occur.\nThe responses below are primarily concerned with electricity, but to a lesser extent, may be applied to natural gas as well.\nAs always, do not bet the house on what we have to say.\nWe are just a little think tank, kind of like the little engine that could.\nAnd we can.\nAnd we do.\nHappy New Year!\nThe CAEM Staff  P.S. If you would like to add a prediction or two, please send an e-mail with your name and contact information to Hope Duncan at hduncan@caem.org  We will post them to our web site ?\nwww.caem.org  Please identify which question below is being addressed by your prediction.\nCAEM PREDICTIONS IN 2002  What does Enron?\ns collapse mean?\n1. Markets work.\nMarkets quickly punish mistakes.\nLittle slack is given for past accomplishments.\nMarkets are ruthlessly impersonal.\n2. No likely short term impact on consumers, other traders will fill the space left by Enron.\nAmazing that a company as large as Enron can fail and hardly cause a ripple in markets.\nTestimonial to benefits of markets.\n3. May have significant impact on public policy advocacy.\nNot obvious who picks up the slack.\nEnron could be counted on to be there, or so it appeared.\nNo more free riders, we will all have to dig deeper and work harder.\nConsumers may be mid to long term losers if movement toward competition collapses, which it might do if states stretch out the transition period to competition.\n4. Enron?\ns collapse was not caused by deregulation.\nViewed thoughtfully, it should not have any effect on deregulation movement.\nDoes not stand for proposition that deregulation is not the right policy.\n5. Look for more regulation and oversight of energy transactions, accounting and business practices.\nA strange legacy for Enron, but a reality.\n6. As a practical matter, it is another setback for restructuring.\nBut not as bad as portrayed by media ?\nEnron was the 600 pound gorilla that angered friends of competition almost as much as foes, thus making them less willing to step forward.\nWill feed growing skepticism many have about restructuring.\n7. Enron?\ns global reach into wholesale and retail markets meant that its policy positions were sometimes blurred (pro-wholesale? pro energy services?) Other corporations will now replace Enron in public policy debates; these corporations may have a clearer focus.\n8. Still, we have lost a champion.\nCAEM will miss their culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations, which led to the unbundling of the classic power contract (or paper or water, etc) into its constituent parts and offered customers choices on each one.\nEnron also pioneered risk assessment and control systems.\nWhat will be the fate of the movement towards retail energy competition in 2002?\n1. CAEM believes that the movement toward retail energy competition will continue ?\nalbeit much more slowly.\n2. Texas is the best model to date and will set the standard for other states in 2002 and beyond.\nWhy?\nThe best incentives are in place for large numbers of commercial and industrial consumers to competitively shop for supply.\nThe Texas model ties changes to the wholesale market to the retail market.\n(Texas, through ERCOT, is unique in this respect.)  No price caps.\nMarket power of incumbents is limited.\nEnlightened leadership at the Texas PUC from 1995 to 2000 (our friend, Pat Wood again ? but we believe Commissioner Perlman is a star as well) and in the Governor?\ns office.\n3. Other states that have already made a decision to move forward will seek to correct deficiencies ?\nPennsylvania, New Jersey, etc.\n?\nor avoid past mistakes altogether ?\nVirginia.\nHowever, there will be very limited movement in these states.\n4. California will continue to suffer from a lack of imagination and poor leadership from the Governor on down.\nThere is a good chance that CAEM will again be awarding Governor Davis the ?\nRed China?\naward in 2002.\n5. Californians will be reminded again that rolling blackouts are a form of ?\ninvoluntary?\nconservation.\n6. Very limited movement, perhaps some experimentation or demonstration projects, in those states that have done nothing to date.\n7. Increasing effort to approximate market-like conditions, but under a regulated, cost-based system, with predictable results.\n8. Actually, beyond Texas, the best hope for significant movement towards competition is in North America is in Canada, particularly Alberta and Ontario.\nGiven the increasing interconnection between the U.S. and Canada, this will slowly work its way into the United States.\n9. It will be another wild ride for energy marketers in 2002.\nMore power to them.\nWhat will happen on the wholesale side of the picture in 2002?\n1. CAEM believes that there will be significant strides made to increase liquidity and competition in the wholesale market for electricity.\n2. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will be successful, to a degree, in implementing Super RTOs (regional transmission organizations).\n3. CAEM supports the Bush Administration?\ns proposal to give eminent domain to FERC for the siting of new transmission lines.\nHowever, this proposal faces tough sledding in Congress.\nCAEM believes it will pass in some form ?\nprobably very watered down ?\nout of necessity, but not out of love.\nMany in Congress still believe we can conserve our way to prosperity.\n4. The Federal government and the states will make progress ?\nprobably embodied in a political deal ?\non greater cooperation.\nThis will be regional in focus.\nBoth sides will give significant concessions to realize this.\n5. New players will enter market as it grows, including the oil companies and more foreign-based companies.\nWildcards/ Predictions in 2002   1. The Bush Administration will come under increasing pressure to show leadership in the area of energy restructuring.\nTo date, the Bush Administration has stayed on the sidelines ?\nexcept making the right noises here and there ?\nof making energy markets more competitive.\nThis will need to change, beginning with more funds and staff devoted to helping the states on the retail side and supporting FERC in their efforts on the wholesale side.\n2. The new Electricity Advisory Board appointed by DOE Secretary Abraham will be seen for what it is ?\na sop to campaign supporters.\nGiven its current make up, we expect very little to come of it.\nCouldn?\nt they find more energy marketers, technology companies ?\nanyone that is a bit more pro-competition?\n3. The Department of Energy will continue to have little impact -- if any -- on energy restructuring issues and will remain largely irrelevant to the competitive energy market.\n4. The Department of Energy will continue to fight for tougher appliance efficiency standards, while totally ignoring the far lower efficiency of electricity production, thus marginalizing its impact on energy efficiency.\n5. ?\nComprehensive?\nenergy legislation will probably pass in 2002.\nThe question is whether it will be truly comprehensive and have a separate and new section devoted to electric restructuring.\n(The Senate version does and the House is working on one.)  Our guess is that it will to some degree.\nOur hope is that the energy legislation moves beyond pork politics and members of Congress will resist the temptation to earmark projects.\nFat chance of that happening, but it is Christmas time.\n6. As part of the political deal, there is the opportunity for a ?\nNew Federalism?\npolicy to be realized for the energy sector.\nIf the Bush Administration truly wants to move competition forward, and yet have the states go along with it, a new block grant with conditions for moving towards competition could be formed to serve as a carrot.\nThe Feds do it with highway funds and education ?\nwhy not energy?\nThe states, familiar with federal block grants for highways and education will try to cut as many of the ?\nstrings?\nattached to the grants as possible.\n7. A major blackout in 2002.\nThe laws of probability suggest that we are due for a reminder about how old our infrastructure is and how the lack of attention to how these markets are performing will have consequences.\nThe U.S. has dodged many bullets in the past ?\nbut probably not this year.\n(BPA will likely not cause the blackout this time, as it did twice in 1996, unless the Pacific Northwest gets a lot of snow this winter or a lot of rain this spring.) ( The blackout will likely not happen in Manhattan, since peak demand was reduced by ~ 300 mW on September 11th.)  We recognize this a risky prediction ?\npredicting what terrorists or what the weather may do always is ?\nbut it is only a matter of time.\n8. The environmental movement will begin to wake up to the fact that its interests are not the same as those of consumer activists.\nCompetition will lead to more efficient production ?\nand thus less pollution ?\nto the extent it is allowed to occur.\nSeeking lower prices at all costs, including the cost to the environment, consumer advocates want to preserve the monopoly model, which has led and will continue to lead to the maximum use of old, and polluting technologies and infrastructure.\n9. For that matter, the anti-coalition (kind of like anti-matter, not much there) of critics should splinter even further vs. organized labor (high costs, high prices).\n10. New grid-enhancing technologies, e.g., superconductivity, and distributed energy technologies, e.g., fuel cells, should make significant market gains in 2002, assuming Congress, DOE and EPA take no further actions to prevent this from happening.\nThere is a lot of pessimism in the distributed energy community right now ?\nand who wouldn?\nt be a bit pessimistic, given the exit of Honeywell from the market, the constant technical setbacks, the wariness of the utilities, the bickering and backbiting, etc.\nBut folks, this is the future ?\nand the future starts now.\n11. EPA will continue to protect the ?\nright?\nof existing generators to pollute at rates an order of magnitude greater than the pollution rates required of new generators, ?\nin the interest of fairness?\n.\n12. EPA will continue to discourage incremental improvements in the efficiency and emissions of existing power plants by insisting that the incremental improvements subject the plants to new source review.\n13. EPA will proceed with issuance of a proposed guidance document requiring combined heat and power systems and building cooling, heating and power systems to achieve better combined electrical and thermal efficiency than the best available separate electric generation and thermal energy conversion technologies, but will not require that all separate electric generation and thermal energy conversion installations use the best available technology.\n(No one will question why this efficiency requirement is coming from EPA and not DOE.)   14.

{"text": "Are you putting words in my mouth Tim.\nThe East is absolutely adamant about having a liquid real-time energy markets  with a \"real supply curve\" and a \"real demand curve\" such that hourly  clearing prices reflect the true economic value of the commodity.\nWith  respect to the number of hourly price signals within an RTO that is  necessary, that is subject to much debate.\nAlthough I prefer a zonal model  for simplicity reasons, the reality is that congestion is more prevalent in  the East in most of the markets and in order to get a functioning real time  energy market, we may have settle for a limited LMP, in which nodal pricing  is necessary for managing the congestion, but proxy buses are created in  zones (3-5 per RTO) for purposes of real-time energy markets.\nOur views, I believe, are still very much aligned, however, I need to make  some progress on the creation of real time energy markets.\nThe zonal  markets implemented in NEPOOL and contemplated for ERCOT result in a  mis-priced commodity with no \"real\" price signal sent to the market.\nOut of  merit generation is and will continue to be dispatched because the congestion  is managed through energy uplift payments (congestion price signal is not  sent to the market).\nThis results in a very inefficient commodity market  where the consumer gets screwed and market makers can't price the commodity  or transportation on a forward basis.\nI hope this clarifies any misunderstanding."}
